{"path":"542825.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a forested landscape interrupted by a large area of what appears to be landslide damage or deforestation. The setting includes densely packed, dark green trees in what could be a forest or mountain region. A significant portion of the earth is exposed in the middle of the image, showing brown, raw earth and disrupted terrain which contrasts sharply with the surrounding greenery.\n\nOn the left edge of this exposed area, one can see a blue line, possibly a tarp or a water body, distinctly visible against the earthy tones. The image also shows other smaller patches of cleared land around the main area, with fallen trees or debris visible.\n\nToward the bottom of the image, there's a body of water in dark blue, bending around the base of the cleared area, delineating the forest's edge. The topography suggests that this area may be on a slope or hillside, given the gradient of the tree lines and the orientation of the collapsed soil toward the water.\n\nThe composition of the image, with natural forest contrasting the damaged land and the water body, highlights a dramatic interaction between natural landscapes and possible human or natural interventions leading to deforestation or geographical shifts.","title":"Clear cutting","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542826","542833","545289","542881","542834","553565","555085","542822","542840","555145","557001","545264","555150","545143","555104","542820"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["deforestation","forest","tarp","earth","exposed","interrupt","orientation","disrupt","cleared","toward"]}
