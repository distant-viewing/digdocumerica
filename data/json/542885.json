{"path":"542885.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image captures a serene beach scene, characterized by a moody and overcast sky. A person on horseback is seen riding along the wet sand near the shore. The horse, appearing to be in mid-stride, is brown with a darker mane and tail, and it carries a rider who is dressed in a dark jacket and light-colored pants, possibly wearing a cap or helmet.\n\nThe beach setting includes rolling ocean waves, which show white foam as they break onto the shore. The sea looks relatively rough, suggesting a windy atmosphere. The beach is bordered on one side by large, dark rocks, among which driftwood and other marine debris are scattered, hinting at recent high tides or stormy weather conditions.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is somewhat solitary and introspective, emphasized by the lone figure of the horse and rider against the vastness of the ocean and the overcast sky. The composition balances the natural elements dynamically, with the rider and horse positioned slightly off-center, enhancing the feeling of movement and the expansive nature of the surrounding landscape.","title":"California--Moonstone Beach","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["542810","542966","542806","543014","542800","543071","542956","544308","542891","544414","543244","546953","543078","554013","547612","543209"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["rider","horse","beach","ocean","mane","shore","horseback","stride","driftwood","tide"]}
