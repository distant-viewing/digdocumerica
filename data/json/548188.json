{"path":"548188.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively outdoor scene featuring a group of people engaged in fishing and leisure activities beside a large body of water. The setting is a sandy beach area lined with numerous fishing rods propped in the sand, pointing towards the water, suggesting a fishing event or gathering.\n\nIn the center of the image, there's a large red tent, and around it, various groups of people can be seen. Some are seated on folding chairs or on the ground, while others stand or walk around. The individuals are dressed in casual outdoor attire suitable for the weather, which seems mild given the lack of heavy clothing.\n\nThere are also several boats visible on the water, indicating that this might be a popular spot for boating as well as fishing. The background features a line of hills or low mountains across the horizon, under a hazy sky, hinting at a wide, open natural environment.\n\nForeground details include coolers and boxes presumably containing supplies or fishing gear, enhancing the recreational ambiance of the scene. The overall atmosphere is informal and convivial, typical of a communal outdoor activity. The photo captures a moment of leisure where people enjoy nature, each otherâ€™s company, and a shared activity.","title":"Family-style fishing on banks of the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548190","548189","544223","548737","550850","549935","544274","543609","552283","546811","542647","544442","542560","543164","548743","550848"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","leisure","prop","cooler","hills","fold","tent","supplies","people","boating"]}
