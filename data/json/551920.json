{"path":"551920.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph shows a vintage Volkswagen Beetle car going through an automatic car wash. The car is painted in a dark color and has \"POLIZEI\" (meaning police in German) written across the front above the bumper. The vehicle displays a license plate marked \"BP 43.\"\n\nThe car wash itself features large roller brushes that are in contact with the car, one visible at the front and others likely surrounding it. These brushes are fluffy and appear to be black and white. Above the car, you can see other components of the car wash mechanism partly in view.\n\nThe setting is an indoor facility, likely a dedicated car wash bay, identifiable by its utilitarian lookâ€”tiled walls with some dirt and wear marks, a rugged floor with a track set into it where the car stands, and a drain visible at the front. There's also some equipment attached to the wall and ceiling, including a hanging hose, some conduits, and lighting fixtures. The atmosphere suggests a somewhat older or industrial type environment supporting routine vehicle maintenance.","title":"A police Volkswagen comes through the automatic washer at police headquarters.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["557924","557926","557875","557921","554336","546665","550796","551912","557862","556712","550909","550908","557905","557850","557853","557878"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["wash","car","brush","front","roller","conduit","contact","bumper","police","license"]}
