{"path":"552171.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph that captures a panoramic view of a coastal city and its surrounding landscape. Here are some detailed components of the image:\n\n1. **Cityscape**: The foreground shows a dense city with numerous buildings densely packed along the coastline. The urban area is spread out and includes various districts with what seems to be houses, industrial buildings, and possibly commercial zones. Roads can be seen throughout, aiding in distinguishing between the different zones of the city.\n\n2. **Water bodies**: The city is bordered by a large body of water, which could be a sea or a large lake. Along the shore, there are indications of industrial or shipping activity with structures like docks visible. There are also several smaller land masses and possibly some floating structures within the water.\n\n3. **Mountain Range**: Dominating the background of the image is an impressive mountain range. These mountains are muscular and extensive, rising abruptly from the relatively flat coastal plain. The peaks are partially covered in snow, indicating their considerable height and possibly the time of year being closer to winter or early spring.\n\n4. **Vegetation and Terrain**: Between the mountains and the urban area, there is a green buffer which looks to be either large tracts of forest or possibly agricultural fields. This transition in vegetation from dense urban to green landscapes and then to rugged mountains creates a stunning contrast.\n\n5. **Sky and Lighting**: The sky is somewhat overcast, giving the light in the image a diffuse quality. This type of lighting reduces shadows and softens the landscape features, although the mountains still look quite dramatic against the sky.\n\nThe image itself, likely taken from an airplane, offers a breathtaking mix of natural beauty and human settlement, illustrating how the city has been built in proximity to significant natural features like the water and mountains.","title":"Port Angeles and Olympic Mountains","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553675","552231","553677","552133","553778","553680","554091","553678","548453","553748","553945","552252","544073","557532","550639","542673"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["mountain","city","zone","buffer","masse","plain","reduce","indication","airplane","distinguish"]}
