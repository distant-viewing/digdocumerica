{"path":"547974.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a group of four people, one child and three adults, walking on a sandy path towards the beach. The environment around them is reminiscent of a coastal dune area, with patches of grass and low shrubbery scattered across the sand. The weather appears to be sunny, casting clear shadows on the sand, suggesting itâ€™s either morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe group seems equipped for a day at the beach, with one adult female on the far right carrying a large yellow bucket, and the child draped in a towel or a light cloth around the shoulders. Another adult, closer to the right, carries a garden rake and wears ankle boots, possibly for digging in the sand or working around the beach area. The man in the center holds a crutch under his left arm, suggesting a physical disability, and wears a loose, light-colored shirt. The woman on the left wears a simple tank top and shorts.\n\nIn the background, there is a view of what looks like a beach access point with simple fencing, and beyond it, outlines of cars and small buildings or beach huts can be seen, indicating a public or semi-public beach area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image and the casual attire of the group suggest a leisurely or perhaps communal activity focused around enjoying the beach and its surroundings.","title":"Students at the spermacetti cove nature center at Sandy Hook set out to study dunes","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["547873","548700","543534","543325","547009","543225","555402","543047","543216","548699","557507","543072","544206","543474","550936","555923"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sand","adult","group","rake","ankle","hut","carry","female","child"]}
