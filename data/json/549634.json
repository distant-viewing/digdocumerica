{"path":"549634.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic scene dominated by vast plumes of billowing smoke. Two prominent smoke columns rise vigorously into the sky, each emanating from what appear to be industrial sources out of frame, possibly stacks or towers due to their vertical structure. The smoke is dense and textured, with the clouds swirling into robust formations that are starkly outlined against the sky behind.\n\nThe smoke varies in color from dark gray to lighter shades of white, indicating variations in density and perhaps the materials being burned. The light, diffused by the smoke, gives the scene an ominous and powerful aesthetic, highlighting the environmental impact of such emissions.\n\nThe background is a bold blue sky, partly obscured by the dense smoke clouds, adding a natural contrast that accentuates the unnatural appearance of the smoke.ượ","title":"Smoke from the burning of old auto batteries","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["553841","550987","547204","546237","545990","544704","545916","550905","545924","550984","547137","551054","545439","550983","545472","550871"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","burn","swirl","varies","emission","variation","clouds","billow","diffuse","density"]}
