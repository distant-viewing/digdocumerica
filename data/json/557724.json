{"path":"557724.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph displays a detailed regional map. The map is predominantly in shades of green and gray, representing varied terrain features such as hills or mountains given the layered contour lines. Various labeled areas possibly indicate names of places, parks, and bodies of water, like \"Unicoi State Park,\" \"Chattahoochee National Forest,\" and \"Roberta's Swamp.\" There are no human figures or animals in the photo; it focuses entirely on the map.\n\nIn the lower-left corner of the map is a small legend with color-coded dots. These dots are labeled \"Efficiency Condo's,\" with colors corresponding to \"Condo's and Single Family\" and \"City Sewage Plant Location,\" suggesting the map might be used for urban planning or real estate purposes. The arrangement and framing suggest this map might be a planning tool displayed either for public viewing or within a professional context. The setting is simple with a light wooden border showcasing the map, emphasizing its informational purpose. The background is plain, focusing all attention on the map itself.","title":"A 1/25,000 scale map depicting land owned by the Alpine Valley Investment Corporation (AVIC) which plans a second alpine village outside of Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown.
