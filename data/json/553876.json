{"path":"553876.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures an intimate and tender scene of two young birds, likely very recent hatchlings, nestled together in a nest. The birds are covered in fluffy, light-colored down with visible tufts of softer, wispy feathers emerging from their heads and bodies, indicating their very young age. One bird is lying down with its head turned slightly towards the other, revealing a small beak and closed eyes, suggesting it is resting or possibly asleep. The other bird appears more alert, with its eye open and pointing upward, likely observing its surroundings or the photographer.\n\nThe nest is composed of tightly woven twigs and branches, contributing to a sense of security and shelter for the hatchlings. This structure is set against a blurred backdrop of greenery, likely leaves, which hints at the nest being positioned within a tree or bush, providing camouflage and protection from predators.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is soft and diffuse, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the delicate textures of the birdsâ€™ feathers. The focus is sharp on the hatchlings and softer on the surroundings, drawing attention to the vulnerability and innocence of the young birds in their natural habitat. The overall composition and natural tones convey a peaceful, yet vibrant snapshot of early life in the natural world.","title":"Choloskee rookery. (From the Sites Exhibition.
