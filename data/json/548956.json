{"path":"548956.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph appears to depict a middle-aged man engaging in an outdoor activity near a body of water, possibly a lake or pond. The setting seems remote and natural, surrounded by trees and grass which are softly out of focus in the background, indicating a peaceful, secluded environment.\n\nThe man is focused on a task that involves using a yellow device, which could be a scientific instrument or some kind of water sampling equipment. He is bending over the water's edge, hands carefully manipulating the object. The emphasis of the scene is on his activity, which suggests a study or examination of the water's properties.\n\nHe is dressed in casual outdoor attire: a short-sleeved, striped, collared shirt and darker pants. A cap on his head helps to shield his eyes from the bright sunlight, suggesting that the photo was taken on a sunny day. Due to the vintage look of the image and the style of the clothing, it suggests the photograph could be from several decades ago.\n\nThe reflection of the sky and surrounding foliage in the water adds a serene quality to the image, with the water acting as a mirror that hints at the clarity and stillness of the environment. The overall mood conveyed is one of tranquility and concentration, capturing a moment of human interaction with the natural world for possibly scientific or environmental purposes.","title":"EPA technician collects water sample from Pahranagat Lake about 10 miles south of Alamo.","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["552110","546298","549012","549628","551406","554848","554535","548972","542556","546307","546847","550962","548831","550268","549007","545386"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["water","sampling","examination","instrument","mirror","kind","world","study","clarity","property"]}
