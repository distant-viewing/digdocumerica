{"path":"544380.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"In the photograph, a young child is depicted engaging in playful exploration at the edge of a body of water, likely a lake or river. The child, who appears to be a toddler, is bending forward, focused on the wet sand at the water's edge. They are holding a small stick, using it either to draw in the sand or to poke at objects or the water itself.\n\nThe child is dressed for warm weather, wearing a light-colored one-piece outfit that fits snugly and has stripes at the lower part resembling swimwear. Adding a charming touch to the scene, the child is wearing a large white cowboy hat, which is slightly tilted forward over their eyes, adding a playful and adventurous aura.\n\nThe setting foreground shows the sandy beach with small rocks and bits of debris scattered about, indicating a natural, unmanicured shoreline. The water is calm with gentle ripples, and the color transitions from a lighter hue near the shore to a darker blue further away, suggesting varying depths.\n\nThe background is predominantly the water body, filling the upper part of the photograph with a simple, unobtrusive nature that brings attention to the child's activities. The lighting suggests it is a bright sunny day, casting distinct shadows and highlighting the vivid colors of the childâ€™s outfit and the rustic tones of the sandy beach. The overall composition conveys a serene yet engaging moment of childhood curiosity and exploration.","title":"Investigations of the beach","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["549105","547727","552940","550241","555398","550244","545539","552279","544200","554499","551544","548837","543468","543459","552341","550229"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","exploration","sand","outfit","beach","swimwear","toddler","water","aura","cowboy"]}
