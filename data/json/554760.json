{"path":"554760.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a serene lakeside view at sunset. In the foreground, dark silhouettes of tall pine trees vertically frame the scene. The central focus is a calm lake that reflects the transitioning hues of the sky, where light fades from a deeper blue to softer tones closer to the horizon. Wispy clouds interspersed in the sky add to the peaceful ambiance. The horizon line is marked by a dense line of trees and undulating hills, which are mirrored on the water's surface, creating an almost symmetrical reflection. The setting sun casts gentle golden light, enhancing the tranquility and natural beauty of the scene. The overall atmosphere is quiet and reflective, typical of a dusky evening in a secluded woodland area.","title":"Sunset over seventh lake in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["552319","554404","543577","550299","554752","554759","550746","554397","554405","543590","543604","557493","543608","543415","554403","552277"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["woodland","undulate","horizon","mirror","sunset","intersperse","transition","evening","line","fade"]}
