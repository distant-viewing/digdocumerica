{"path":"551311.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene with a distinctive, artistic focus. In the foreground, blurred branches create an organic frame, casting dark, interestingly shaped shadows over the image. This natural overlay partially obscures and adds texture to the scene behind it.\n\nIn the background, calm, textured water spans across the frame, colored in varying shades of dark purple and blue, suggesting the photo was taken during the late evening or at twilight. In the middle distance, a small fishing boat with at least one visible occupant moves across the water. The boat creates a gentle wake, rippling through the water's surface, which catches the light differently than the surrounding areas, adding a sense of movement to the otherwise still water.\n\nThe overall mood is peaceful and isolated, evoking a sense of calm and quiet solitude. The use of the branches as a natural frame not only focuses the viewer's attention towards the center of the image but also enhances the atmosphere of being a discreet observer to this quiet, fleeting moment on the water.","title":"Pontoon boat on Osage arm of the lake framed by the branches of a cedar tree","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["549374","552292","551214","554147","547556","552310","549380","550324","543143","548247","557255","547549","552039","547044","545120","551313"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["overlay","branch","observer","water","occupant","boat","wake","isolate","purple","frame"]}
