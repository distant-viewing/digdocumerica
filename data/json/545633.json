{"path":"545633.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a sweeping view of a wide river valley set in a vast, barren landscape. The river snakes through the center, with multiple meandering curves visible, creating a stark contrast against the sandy, sediment-rich banks and the various pools of water collecting on the sides. The water appears muddy and varies in color, from dark browns to light blues, reflecting the sky overhead.\n\nThe landscape is surrounded by steep, rugged cliffs and plateaus, characteristic of canyon terrains, which exhibit layered rock formations in earthy tonesâ€”ranging from deep browns to reddish hues. The towering cliffs stand under a slightly overcast sky with sunlight filtering through the clouds, casting a luminous quality over parts of the river and the valley.\n\nThe foreground shows rough, gravelly terrain leading towards the river, indicating erosion or deposition areas. There are no visible plants or greenery, emphasizing the arid nature of the region. The overall mood of the photograph is serene yet austere, capturing the timeless and weathered beauty of this geological landscape.","title":"In October, 1972, a pipeline of the Texas-New Mexico Pipeline Company burst, releasing 285,000 gallons of crude oil into the San Juan River.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["545632","545629","543977","545640","545787","544748","545794","544752","545636","543647","545301","549456","543716","554777","543793","544744"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","cliff","valley","deposition","brown","plateaus","overhead","canyon","collect","snake"]}
