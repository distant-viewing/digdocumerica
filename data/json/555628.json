{"path":"555628.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene featuring a dirt road leading towards a mound of earth that blocks further passage. The road is flanked by lush greenery, including trees and bushes under a clear blue sky. On the right side of the barrier, there's a sign that reads \"ROAD CLOSED\" and another that says \"PRIVATE PROPERTY, KEEP OUT.\" These signs are mounted on a wooden post on the right side of the road. The surrounding area is tranquil and appears to be in a natural, possibly forested area with no visible buildings or people. The composition of the photo highlights the obstruction in what would otherwise be a passable road, emphasizing themes of restriction or private land.","title":"Road closed by the hanna coal company because of nearby strip mining off route #800 near Barnesville, Ohio","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["555582","555647","545624","554789","552076","544245","545620","544262","547081","552005","545159","547111","543104","548845","544292","547095"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["road","restriction","say","mound","flanke","passage","foreste","property","block","barrier"]}
