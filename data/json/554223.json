{"path":"554223.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, wintery scene featuring a woman engaging in a leisurely activity outdoors. She is seated on a metal patio chair at a small, round table, positioned under a decorative umbrella that sports a frilly edge and floral patterns on its green and white fabric. The woman, appearing focused and relaxed, is dressed in a dark, floral-printed dress with a high neckline, and she is wearing glasses. She is reading or writing in a notebook, with a pen in her hand and a few items on the table, including what appears to be a portable tape player and a small cup or mug.\n\nSurrounding the scene is freshly fallen snow that blankets the ground and partially covers the lower regions of the trees and shrubs nearby. The presence of snow suggests it might be cold, yet the clear skies and bright sunlight indicates a pleasant day. Behind the woman, a wooden structure is visible, adorned with a sign featuring discernible words \"Photo Shop.\" There might be an element of commercial activity or a public place nearby, like a ski resort or a park, which offers photo services.\n\nThe composition of the image, with natural light and shadows cast by the trees, enhances the peaceful and somewhat contrasting setting of enjoying a calm, intellectual pursuit amidst a snowy landscape.","title":"West Village Tavern on Snowmass Mountain","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["543835","546566","546555","545510","551970","554493","550940","546479","553156","545525","546547","543755","557199","554228","554227","557180"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["table","neckline","mug","woman","tape","notebook","patio","pursuit","player","ski"]}
