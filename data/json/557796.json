{"path":"557796.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a young child, possibly a toddler, seated on a brown wooden folding chair in an outdoor setting. The child has light-colored hair and a serious expression on their face as they look slightly to the side. The child is dressed in a traditional-style outfit that consists of a white shirt under a gray sleeveless jumper with decorative embroidery or stitching at the chest. This is paired with matching gray shorts. Both the jumper and shorts appear to be held up by a pair of light-colored suspenders. On their feet, the child wears dark brown shoes with yellow laces, and their legs are clad in white socks that are pulled up high.\n\nThe child's hands rest on their lap, and the left hand of an adult can be seen resting on the back of the chair, suggesting the presence and protective gesture of a parent or guardian though the adult is mostly outside the frame. The background behind the child shows a grassy area, with the blurred forms of people and other chairs suggesting a social or family gathering. The overall ambiance is casual and the setting appears to be a daytime outdoor environment, possibly a garden or park. The mood captured is a mix of calm and contemplation.","title":"The son of City Councilman Jeff Ash sits outside the circus tent at the fifth annual Oktoberfest at Helen.
