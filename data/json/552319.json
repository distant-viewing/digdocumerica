{"path":"552319.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This image captures a serene lakeside setting during the time of sunset. The composition foregrounds the undulating dark blue waters of the lake, which occupy the lower portion of the photograph. The background shows a densely wooded area extending from the midsection to the upper right corner, populated predominantly by tall, dark coniferous trees. Sunlight is filtering through these trees from a low angle, suggesting it's either early morning or late evening.\n\nThe sky, which covers much of the upper part of the frame, is scattered with both dense and wispy clouds reflecting varying tones, primarily pinks and blues as they catch the fading sunlight. On the left side of the image, streaks of blue sky are more prominent, contrasting with the darker clouds. \n\nThere is no visible human activity; the image focuses solely on the natural beauty and tranquility of the scene. The atmosphere is peaceful and quiet, with an emphasis on the interplay of light through the trees and the reflective surface of the water. The edge of a landform is visible on the far left, indicating that the lake is fairly large. The overall mood of the photo is calm and contemplative.","title":"Sunset on puget sound near marysville","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554405","554760","554752","554404","551207","543577","550493","554397","550735","554759","550299","550746","543618","543608","557493","543611"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["clouds","lake","landform","pink","fading","streak","sunlight","lakeside","emphasis","catch"]}
