{"path":"543109.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The image captures a construction scene. In the foreground, a large, rusted metal object with numerous rounded pegs or bolts is prominently displayed, leading the viewer's eye towards the middle ground. The pegs/bolts are arranged in irregular rows, and their worn, rusty surfaces suggest weathering and outdoor exposure.\n\nThe middle ground shows a vast area of disturbed, bare earth possibly indicative of a large-scale excavation or construction project. This area is flanked by various types of construction machinery, including at least two large yellow excavators visible in the background, actively engaged in moving earth or digging. These machines add a dynamic element to the scene, suggesting ongoing work and development.\n\nIn the background, the environment transitions to a more natural setting with lush green grass and a few sparse trees emerging amidst a misty or foggy environment, which gives the image a slightly ethereal or damp atmosphere. Small bright markers, possibly used for surveying or marking construction zones, punctuate the grassy area, adding spots of color (reds and whites) to the predominantly earthy tones of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on both the industrial and natural elements, creates a narrative about human impact on the environment and the changes wrought by construction projects. The use of perspective, with the industrial foreground leading to the natural background, might also suggest a commentary on the encroachment of industrial development into natural landscapes.","title":"California--Bodega Bay harbor","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["554809","549169","547225","547926","549255","554815","544167","555633","556939","557733","545677","553383","554830","552814","543785","549204"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["construction","bolt","project","survey","earth","development","encroachment","excavator","commentary","dig"]}
