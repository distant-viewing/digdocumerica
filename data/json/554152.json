{"path":"554152.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures two intricately carved wooden statues near a beach. The statues are symbolic or ritualistic figures, possibly with a cultural or spiritual significance. They are dark in color, likely due to the wood used or weathering effects, and show detailed carvings, featuring human-like forms with expressive faces and elaborate headdresses or hairdos. The statues have a powerful presence, standing upright and facing in different directions, which may suggest a guardian-like role at the location.\n\nThe setting of the statues is a sandy beach with dark, volcanic rocks scattered around, typical of oceanic islands with volcanic origins. The ocean is visible in the background, calm with a clear blue sky overhead dotted with light clouds. Also noticeable in the far background, moored in the calm sea, is a small sailboat, adding a hint of human activity and recreation to the otherwise tranquil scene.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the ancient, weathered statues against the timeless beauty of the oceanic landscape highlights a connection between the cultural artifacts and the natural environment, possibly indicating the importance of the sea in the cultural or historical context from which these statues originate.","title":"Ancient statues in city of refuge national historical park near honaunau on the western side of the island","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554151","554153","554150","549533","550496","548288","553769","543139","548810","553747","542884","543075","546961","545081","558269","543492"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["statue","beach","originate","carving","origin","sea","moor","artifact","carve","importance"]}
