{"path":"550015.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The image shows a business sign mounted on the corner of a brick building. The sign reads \"LORD & JEALOUS WOOL\" in black lettering on a white background. The surroundings suggest a possibly cold or overcast day, as evidenced by the bare tree visible in the background and the muted, gray sky. The corner of the building, to the left of the sign, has a distinctly aged look with visible wear and some white paint along the brick edges. Electrical lines and a faintly visible tree add to the background elements, giving a sense of a typical urban or suburban roadside setting. The sign itself shows signs of wear and ageing, especially around the edges, indicating it may have been exposed to the elements for a considerable time.","title":"Wool mill in city mills, one of some 35 manufacturing cities and towns on the eighty mile charles river","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["555439","552533","554781","555442","554924","552964","545411","548612","556047","555410","550131","557211","554185","550049","558127","545317"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["sign","corner","brick","urban","suburban","roadside","lettering","edge","evidence","business"]}
