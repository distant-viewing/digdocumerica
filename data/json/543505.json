{"path":"543505.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene natural scene in what appears to be a mountainous area. In the foreground, two individuals are seated on a large rock beside a calm, reflective lake surrounded by trees. The person on the left is wearing a white shirt with a geometric pattern, jeans, and white sneakers, sitting with legs crossed and looking out towards the water. The person on the right wears a striped shirt, jeans, and is also seated looking out at the lake, positioned slightly behind the first individual.\n\nIn the background, towering cliffs and mountains dominate the scene, with large swathes of exposed rock and sparse vegetation. The sky is clear and bright, suggesting a sunny day. There are trees with young, bright green leaves around the edges of the frame, signifying spring or early summer. The stillness of the water creates a mirror-like surface, reflecting the majestic rocky landscape and the trees surrounding it, enhancing the tranquility of the setting.","title":"California -- mammoth mt","placename":"Mammoth Mountain (Calif.)","location":"Mammoth Mountain, California","nn1":["543535","549471","553396","543203","543443","554460","548963","543503","545767","543601","545038","543816","554516","549716","551942","548833"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["jeans","lake","sneaker","mountains","rock","towere","signify","rocky","person","seate"]}
