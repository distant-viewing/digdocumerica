{"path":"555879.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph shows a rural outdoor environment with agricultural activity. Central in the image is a man operating a muddy red tractor pulling a soil cultivation tool, most likely a harrow, across a freshly tilled field. The tractor, with its wheels heavily soiled, is actively engaged in turning over dark soil, and you can see dust and debris being kicked up from the movement.\n\nIn the background, the landscape opens up into a vast flat area with visible water bodies and a mountain range on the horizon under a blue, clear sky. Near the horizon, a couple of small white cars along with a few other vehicles are parked beside what could be an unpaved roadside. This setting suggests that the location might be a remote agricultural area near a large water body, possibly a lake, given the flatness and the presence of the distant mountains. The setting exudes a sense of openness and rural activity commonly found in farming territories.","title":"Disposal site for the approximately 1,200,000 gallons of liquid sludge from the nearby contaminated five-acre pond.
