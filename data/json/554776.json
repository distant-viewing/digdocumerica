{"path":"554776.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene, natural landscape centered around a body of water, presumably a pond or a small lake. The water reflects the sky and the surrounding vegetation, creating a mirror image effect. The banks of the pond are uneven and marshy, with bare trees and shrubs lining the edge, suggesting that the photo might have been taken in late fall or early winter. The background features a denser accumulation of trees and a hill, indicating that the setting is in a wooded or forested area. The sky is overcast, giving the scene a muted, soft light which enhances the tranquility of the image.\n\nOn the right side of the image, near the shore, there are small visible rocks and possibly driftwood, which add texture to the otherwise smooth surface of the water's edge. The overall color palette consists of earthy tones—browns, grays, and muted greens—typical of a late-season landscape. The image does not include any people or visible wildlife, focusing solely on the quiet, undisturbed natural environment.","title":"Sediment from strip mining operations of the Hanna Coal Company is filling this stream.
