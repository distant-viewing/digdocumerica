{"path":"548073.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph presents an artistic composition using shadows to create an underwater illusion. It captures the shadows of two fish, with the larger one positioned above the smaller. The shadows are cast on what appears to be a textured surface resembling the ocean floorâ€”a mottled and uneven terrain which enhances the aquatic imagery. The lighting and shadows impart a bluish-grey color to the image, contributing to the underwater feel. \n\nThe composition is simple yet evocative, with the fish appearing to be in motion. The fish are detailed, with visible fins and tail, suggesting movement and life. There's a shadow line across the background that might represent a water surface or simply be a boundary created by the light source. The upper region of the image is darker, which could suggest the deeper area of the water or just a variance in light intensity. All these elements combine to create a dynamic yet peaceful scene, reminiscent of a natural aquatic environment.","title":"Fish-counting station with public viewing windows under construction at Bonneville Dam.
