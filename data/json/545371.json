{"path":"545371.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph captures a man engaged in a manual labor activity outdoors. He walks along a gravelly path, carrying a bucket in his left hand and a long-handled, flat, circular tool, possibly a sieve or simple dredge, in his right hand. The setting is rural, with lush green trees in the background and some grass visible along the edges of the path.\n\nThe man is dressed in work clothes: a long-sleeved, button-up shirt, trousers tucked into rubber boots, and a cap on his head. His attire and the tools he carries suggest he might be involved in agricultural activities, possibly tending to a nearby water source or performing maintenance. The environment appears to be warm and sunny, with the foliage lush and verdant, indicating late spring or summer.\n\nOverall, there's a sense of solitary labor and a rustic setting conveyed in the image, highlighting an aspect of rural life.","title":"Workman on way to clean up a polluted creek","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["543781","548831","546380","546383","544371","546916","544154","545386","548299","548761","543792","550251","554937","544094","554047","552574"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["labor","tool","path","rubber","hand","button","clothe","boot","bucket","source"]}
