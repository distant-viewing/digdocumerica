{"path":"555618.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph features a hilly terrain covered in plowed soil, suggesting an agricultural landscape. The ground is uneven with visible furrows, indicative of recent tilling. The color of the soil is rich, ranging from dark brown to reddish hues. Sparse green vegetation patches are scattered across the terrain, which indicate either the start of plant growth or remnants of previous cultivation.\n\nThe landscape slopes upward, forming a mound-like hill that stretches throughout the frame. Towards the left, the hill gently descends, possibly leading into a flat or another gradient. The sky above is clear with a soft blue tone, which suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, given the subdued light.\n\nThere's a noticeable absence of any human or mechanical presence, which emphasizes the natural and rural aspect of the scene. No buildings, fences, or other man-made structures are visible, presenting an undisturbed agricultural setting. The overall composition focuses on the expansive openness of the rural landscape and the texture of the plowed soil, providing a sense of solitude and peace.","title":"This recontoured land in southeastern Ohio has been fertilized and seeded by the coal companies which strip mined it.
