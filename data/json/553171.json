The woman, on the left, has curly, voluminous hair and wears round glasses with a smile that radiates happiness. She's dressed in a dark jacket and leans slightly towards the man next to her. The man, on the right, with an equally joyful expression, showcases a well-groomed afro. He is dressed in a mustard-yellow jacket over a pink shirt.\n\nThe composition focuses on these two figures from a close, slightly raised angle, capturing their facial expressions and upper bodies in detail against a blurred background that hints at a bustling outdoor social setting, likely a street or public area filled with other people going about their day. The sunlight enhances their cheerful demeanors and adds a glow to the scene, making it a strong depiction of friendship or camaraderie. The moment feels candid and genuine, filled with warmth and vivacity.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: enjoying a performance of the elder high school band, one of the activities of the catholic school's 50th anniversary celebration","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551028","553178","549299","553279","554852","551016","557738","553536","554900","553202","556525","547063","545612","551462","553153","556142"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["friendship","mustard","groome","happiness","afro","radiate","female","jacket","camaraderie","go"]}
