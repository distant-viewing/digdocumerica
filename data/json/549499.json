{"path":"549499.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a river with a distinct white water trail caused by turbulence and possibly activities like boating. To the left, there is a highway with cars moving along it, bordered by dense greenery and trees. Beside the highway, on a prominent promontory, there is a modern-looking building with a circular shape, adjacent to what appears to be parking areas and more structured landscaping. The right side of the image shows another body of water that merges with the turbulent river path, separated by a large rock or cliff formation. Overall, the picture presents a mix of natural and developed environments seen from above, highlighting interaction between human infrastructure and natural water bodies.","title":"Aerial view of foam flow pattern on the Niagara River just below the falls.
