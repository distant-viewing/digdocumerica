{"path":"557962.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a large steel railway bridge crossing over a valley filled with verdant, densely packed trees. The bridge spans across the image from the left to the right, supported by tall concrete pillars that elevate the bridge high above the valley floor. A train is visible on the bridge, moving from left to right and partially obscured by the bridge structure itself.\n\nBeneath the bridge, white smoke or steam billows up from a train that appears to be moving through the valley below, suggesting the presence of a lower railway track running underneath the higher bridge. The smoke is thick and rich, and it partially obscures the lush greenery and the details of the lower section of the scene.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment of industrial activity integrated with a natural environment, featuring technological elements like the bridge and trains juxtaposed against the backdrop of a richly wooded landscape. The lighting in the photo suggests it is taken during the day with shadows indicating either morning or late afternoon sun, adding a serene yet dynamic quality to the scene. The composition uses the perspective and lines of the bridge to draw the viewerâ€™s eye across the picture, connecting the technological elements with the natural environment harmoniously.","title":"Cuyahoga valley line steam powered weekend excursion train passes under the Ohio turnpike bridge which spans the cuyahoga valley near Cleveland.
