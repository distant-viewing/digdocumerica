{"path":"543160.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a landscape comprising a sandy foreground, tree clusters, and an industrial backdrop under a slightly hazy sky. The foreground features a stretch of sand with patches of low vegetation, likely coastal flora. A rough, sandy trail appears to cut through, meandering towards the background.\n\nThe mid-ground is marked by a dense line of trees, possibly a small forest or windbreak, which partially obscures the view of the background. Behind this natural barrier, a row of parked cars is visible, suggesting the presence of a nearby road or parking area.\n\nThe background is dominated by an industrial complex. Multiple tall stacks release smoke or steam into the air. Several large, cylindrical structures, typical of manufacturing or power plants, are evident. The industrial setting contrasts with the natural elements in the foreground, providing a juxtaposition of man-made and natural environments.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a scene that blends industrial activity with a somewhat natural coastal landscape, under a broad daylight setting that casts clear light across the scene, enhancing colors and details.","title":"California--Moss Landing","placename":"Moss Landing (Calif.)","location":"Moss Landing, California","nn1":["547539","545013","545989","543813","543668","545112","545993","545053","547198","552544","552190","543989","544039","551959","545020","546073"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["stretch","flora","trail","manufacturing","stack","barrier","steam","complex","daylight","sand"]}
