{"path":"556001.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man in the process of updating a train schedule board inside a station. The man is wearing a bright red jacket and black-rimmed glasses. His expression appears focused as he adjusts a sliding text plate on the board, which states \"TODAY'S TRAIN SCHEDULE WESTWARD.\" The board displays two train numbers along with their due and expected times. The backdrop includes a window with mullions, through which daylight is visible, and a partial view of a brick wall. The setting has an old-time, functional aesthetic, emphasized by the use of a traditional mechanical schedule board. The overall mood conveyed is one of routine and careful attention to detail.","title":"Amtrak station agent at Dodge City, Kansas, places the expected arrival time of the westbound Southwest Limited on a schedule board as part of his duties.
