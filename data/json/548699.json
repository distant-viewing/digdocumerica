{"path":"548699.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a seaside scene where four women and a baby are walking along the shore. The background features a calm blue sea merging subtly with a slightly paler sky at the horizon. The lighting suggests it might be midday given the brightness and clarity in the image.\n\nFrom left to right, the first three women appear to be in their late teens to early twenties and are dressed in bikinis. The first woman wears a yellow bikini and has short hair. Next to her, the second woman has her hair pulled back and is dressed in a swimsuit cover-up with a floral pattern, visibly enjoying the water as it splashes around her feet. The third woman is also in a yellow bikini and walks confidently with her head slightly turned towards the second woman.\n\nOn the far right, there is a slightly older woman, possibly in her late twenties, holding a baby with both hands. The woman is also in a bikini top paired with denim shorts, and the baby appears content in her arms. Both are halfway in the water and slightly apart from the first three women, adding a dynamic to the group suggesting they might be catching up to the others, or simply enjoying the moment independently.\n\nThe image evokes a sense of leisure and familial or friendly connection, embraced by the serene beach setting.","title":"Tourists at the public beach near Long Key in the central Florida Keys","placename":"Florida Keys (Fla.)","location":"Florida Keys, Florida","nn1":["543534","547009","546851","547688","557507","544206","550936","548793","546768","543499","548700","547507","553951","547974","550920","556293"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["bikini","woman","baby","twenty","teen","swimsuit","hair","dynamic","foot","midday"]}
