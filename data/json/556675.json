{"path":"556675.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban scene, specifically inside a subway station. On the right side of the image, there's a well-lit newsstand covered with various magazines and newspapers displayed in racks and on overhead shelves. Inside the newsstand, two people appear to be working; one of them is writing or reading something, while the other, wearing glasses, is facing away from the direction of the camera.\n\nTo the left, there's a man standing in the foreground, facing slightly towards the newsstand. He wears a light-colored trench coat and slacks, indicating cooler weather or a professional setting. From his attire and posture, he seems to be either waiting for someone or watching the activity at the newsstand.\n\nThe background is a dimly lit subway environment with dirty brick walls, indicative of an older or less-maintained section of the subway system. There's a sign that reads \"New York State Lottery Tickets Sold Here,\" associated with the newsstand, announcing the sale of lottery tickets at this location.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photograph is slightly moody and somber because of the stationâ€™s dim lighting, contrasting with the bright illumination of the newsstand. This setting appears ordinary yet characteristic of many bustling urban transit systems, capturing a slice of city life.","title":"Magazine stand is located only a few steps away from a platform on the Lexington avenue line of the subway.  In 1970 the New York city transit authority system handled an average of 2.1 million person daily which makes it the longest system in the world.
