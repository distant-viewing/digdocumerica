{"path":"542652.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene during sunset. In the foreground, two black cows are prominently featured; one is slightly blurred and positioned on the left side facing towards the camera, while the other, on the right, is grazing with its head down. The light from the setting sun subtly highlights the textures of their coats.\n\nThe background is divided into various layers of landscape elements. The middle ground showcases lush orchards arranged in neat rows, hinting at a well-maintained agricultural setting. Beyond the orchard, the landscape gently rises into small hills which are covered with a sparse green vegetation, adding a soft contrast to the darker foreground.\n\nThe sky above these hills glows with the warm hues of the setting sun, casting a soft, natural light over the entire scene. A fence runs horizontally, partially visible in the lower middle section of the image, delineating the boundary of the pasture. The tranquil and picturesque setting suggests a peaceful end to the day in a rural farming area.","title":"Black Angus cattle and citrus grove","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["542960","557554","542627","554560","542628","545901","545153","542626","550833","552566","554071","557012","548984","557119","543318","557749"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["pasture","sun","cow","hill","farming","boundary","end","coat","sunset","head"]}
