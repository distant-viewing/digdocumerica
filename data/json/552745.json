{"path":"552745.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph portrays a distinctly gritty, urban scene centered around a façade of an aged building with a worn-down look. Two vertically aligned windows punctuate the dirty, peeling taupe wall.\n\nIn the upper window, a woman leans out slightly, looking downward with an observant gaze. She appears to be an African-American adult, wearing a patterned, light-colored blouse. Her expression seems engaged and observant, suggesting she might be watching something happening on the street below or perhaps interacting with someone outside the frame. She occupies her window from an elevated perspective, adding a sense of depth to the scene.\n\nThe lower window is open, but there is no one visible. It reveals a partial view of the interior, which looks sparse and unadorned. This window frames the lower section of the composition and complements the upper window by adding an aspect of emptiness in contrast to the occupied upper window.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo evokes a sense of everyday life in a possibly lower-income urban neighborhood, captured with a focus on personal moments amidst a decaying urban environment. The muted colors and natural light contribute to a feeling of quiet resignation and the endurance of daily life in this setting.","title":"Woman looks out of the window of her apartment in North Philadelphia.","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["543028","548232","542802","544410","552956","548246","557846","553554","549864","550123","553592","552965","552757","555897","553557","549285"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["window","occupy","income","emptiness","happen","façade","look","punctuate","peel","one"]}
