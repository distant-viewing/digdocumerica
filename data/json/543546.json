The foreground prominently features the lake's pebbly bed under crystal-clear water, with smooth stones visible in various shades of gray, brown, and black. The lake itself is calm with gentle ripples, reflecting the hues of the sky and mountains in the background. \n\nIn the middle ground, you can see the shoreline populated with dense trees, typical of a coniferous forest. Several small buildings or cabins, barely visible, suggest a human presence without disturbing the natural beauty of the scene. The background is dominated by a range of mountains under a clear blue sky, hinting at the vastness of the landscape and providing a sense of tranquil isolation.\n\nNo people are visible in the scene, emphasizing the quiet and untouched nature of the environment. The composition of the photograph, with its layers from the pebbly bottom of the lake to the expansive mountain range, creates a peaceful and contemplative mood, inviting the viewer to appreciate the pristine and tranquil aspect of this natural setting.","title":"Gradations of algae and silt from clear shore line  -  coast guard shores of lake tahoe","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543547","543816","550493","550579","548034","554527","555692","554526","554529","543643","551207","543531","554752","554616","555388","545229"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lake","mountain","shoreline","crystal","grace","disturb","range","appreciate","bed","cabin"]}
