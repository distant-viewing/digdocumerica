{"path":"551328.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene featuring a large deciduous tree with a robust trunk and sprawling branches, set against a lush, natural background. The foliage on the tree is dense, with dark green leaves, and some of the top branches appear leafless, suggesting either seasonal changes or the health of the tree. The tree is positioned behind the remnants of a ruined stone building, which possibly appears to have been a small house or hut. This building's walls are partially intact, with no roof, and the structure is overtaken by greenery, indicating long-term abandonment. The area surrounding the ruins and the tree is overgrown with various bushes and smaller trees, suggesting a wild or rural setting. The backdrop hints at a rolling landscape typical of a forested or rural environment. The light and color tones suggest this might be on an overcast day or in a shaded area, enhancing the scene's somewhat mysterious and serene ambience. The overall mood conveyed is peaceful yet poignant, charged with a sense of history and nature reclaiming human artifacts.","title":"Abandoned and vandalized tourist cabins by the side of route 54 at new linn creek, Missouri","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["543198","544942","557622","546971","551329","554099","558103","554999","551344","552101","543488","542570","557623","545966","550792","554977"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["ruin","tree","hut","charge","branch","artifact","reclaim","health","shaded","ambience"]}
