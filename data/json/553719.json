{"path":"553719.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a busy urban street scene dominated by a traffic jam. Multiple cars, styled like typical American models from what might be the 1970s or 1980s, fill the road. The cars are waiting in what appears to be a traffic queue, showing a variety of colors such as blue, white, yellow, and black.\n\nIn the foreground, a blue car is prominently visible, with the driver visible inside, looking straight ahead. To the right of the frame is a traffic signage that reads \"EXPRESS BUS ONLY\" with an arrow pointing downwards, indicating a lane designated for express buses.\n\nThe background suggests a tree-lined street typical of a suburban or urban area. The overall lighting also indicates that this photo could have been taken during late afternoon when shadows are elongate, adding to the depth and texture of the image.\n\nThe focus of the image is somewhat shallow, with the nearest objects in sharper detail compared to those further away, which blend into a softer focus. This composition guides the viewer's focus primarily to the signage and the nearby car.","title":"Morning rush hour traffic to Honolulu from the east on Kalanianaole Highway.
