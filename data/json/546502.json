{"path":"546502.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph depicts a street scene captured under a large overpass, likely during late afternoon based on the lighting. The focal point of the image is a United States Post Office located in Columbus, Indiana, as announced by the bold lettering on the window of the building visible through the overpass. The zip code \"47201\" is noted below the location name.\n\nA vintage car, appearing to be from the 1970s, is parked right in front of the viewer, under the shade of the overpass. The car is a dark color, possibly black or dark blue, and is designed with a sleek, curved body typical of the sports coupes from that era. There is a person visible inside the car, though details are not clear.\n\nIn the background, beyond the post office signage, parts of other buildings can be seen, suggesting a typical small-town setting with multi-story brick buildings. There is some greenery visible, including shrubs and lawns, adding a sense of life and color contrast to the urban elements.\n\nThe scene is captured from a perspective that uses the rectangular concrete supports of the overpass as framing devices, creating a visually striking composition that draws the eye towards the central part of the image. The lighting under the overpass casts shadows and creates an interplay of light and dark, enhancing the atmospheric quality of the photograph.","title":"Main entrance of the post office","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["551097","548889","555584","557655","556709","550149","551106","550012","546440","558028","552602","552526","545333","550111","545353","550022"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["overpass","code","coupe","car","lettering","support","lawn","device","sport","office"]}
