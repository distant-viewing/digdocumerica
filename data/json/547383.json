{"path":"547383.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant square dancing event taking place in an indoor arena. The dance floor is filled with couples participating in a dance, with many of them mid-twirl, showcasing a dynamic and joyful atmosphere. The women are wearing full, bell-shaped skirts in bright colors such as yellow, blue, and pink, typical of square dance attire, paired with white blouses or tops. The men are dressed in dark pants and lighter-colored shirts, some wearing bolo ties, which add a traditional touch to their outfits.\n\nAround the perimeter of the dance floor, there are spectators seated at long tables covered with white cloths. The audience consists of people in casual attire, watching and perhaps waiting for their turn to dance. The setting has an informal yet organized feel, typical of community gatherings focused on dance and entertainment.\n\nThe lighting in the arena casts shadows on the floor, enhancing the sense of movement and activity. The ceiling is not visible, suggesting the focus is entirely on the dancers and the spectators. Overall, the composition captures a festive and communal spirit, typical of square dancing events where socializing and enjoyment are key elements.","title":"The Pershing Memorial Auditorium is the scene of Lincoln's 33rd annual square dance festival.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547271","547403","547334","558284","558286","547387","547317","547386","547371","558285","557790","551710","547274","553241","553235","553268"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["dance","arena","dancing","floor","spectator","dancer","entertainment","spirit","event","perimeter"]}
