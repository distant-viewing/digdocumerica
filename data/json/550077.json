{"path":"550077.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a moment from what appears to be a public demonstration or event. A man and a woman are featured prominently in the foreground. The man has curly hair and is smiling as he talks to the woman. He is wearing casual attire, which includes a light-colored, possibly long-sleeve shirt and jeans.\n\nThe woman's back is facing the camera, and she is holding a large yellow sign above her shoulders, which largely obscures her outfit. The sign contains text promoting \"Lunch & Dinner Bikini Lunches\" along with a street address and an invitation to visit. \n\nIn the background, we can see a mix of individuals who might be spectators or participants in the event. They are gathered around and under the shade of trees in what looks like a plaza or open urban area. Modern-style buildings surround the area, and there's a clear sky above.\n\nThe environment is lively, and the mood seems to be energetic and engaged, with people dressed in light, casual attire suitable for a warm day.","title":"Live advertising in Chester Commons, popular downtown mini-park","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["553280","553321","553244","558295","553279","554179","553761","543932","551019","553204","558293","553267","553275","551460","551011","551028"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["woman","address","demonstration","event","plaza","spectator","participant","attire","shoulder","sign"]}
