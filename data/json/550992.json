{"path":"550992.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph depicts a significant amount of smoke bellowing from multiple chimneys, set against a backdrop of tree-covered hills. The scene takes place under a moody sky, which contributes to the dramatic atmosphere of the image. The smoke, emanating from industrial structures, varies in color from white to darker shades, suggesting varying densities or materials being burned. The dense smoke plumes dominate the view, almost masking the industrial facilities and partially obscuring the hills behind. This scene likely illustrates environmental pollution associated with industrial activities. The photograph exudes a somber tone, reflecting on the impact of industrialization on the natural landscape.","title":"Emission from the Union Carbide Ferro Alloy plant darkens the sky at Alloy, WV.","placename":"Charleston (W.
