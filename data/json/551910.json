The architecture features classical details with high windows and prominent signage displaying the restaurant's name along with multiple Martini logos.\n\nThe street is filled with a variety of vintage cars, densely packed and displaying an array of colors from red, white, yellow, blue to darker shades. Amid the parked cars, pedestrians navigate the space. The people visible are adults dressed in typical fashion of the late 20th century; men in suits and women in dresses, indicative of the era. Their activity lends the image a dynamic feel as they engage in various actions such as walking, talking, or emerging from their cars.\n\nThe restaurant itself spills onto the sidewalk with an outdoor seating area where several patrons can be seen dining or enjoying beverages. The tables are covered with striped tablecloths, and the patrons appear to be enjoying a sunny day, contributing to a leisurely, relaxed ambiance. \n\nThe restaurant and the street action together paint a vivid picture of urban life during this period, highlighting social interaction and the architectural style of the time.","title":"An ever present jumble of cars has substantially reduced the pleasure of outdoors at the popular Cafe Mozart.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["549669","551846","551790","551637","549659","549681","551849","549872","551634","549679","550037","551788","549672","543471","551635","546428"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["restaurant","patron","street","action","car","tablecloth","beverage","architecture","seating","logo"]}
