{"path":"543843.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This image depicts a dramatic and rugged landscape, characterized by gnarled and twisted dead trees. The trees, which are prominently featured in the foreground and middle ground, have bare, stripped branches showing no signs of foliage. Their pale and weathered trunks seem sculpted by harsh weather conditions, adding a stark, almost eerie element to the scene.\n\nThe setting appears to be a high-altitude or mountainous area, given the rocky ground and sparse vegetation. The rocks are irregular and jagged, suggesting a harsh, unforgiving environment where these trees once thrived but now stand as stark remnants.\n\nThe sky above forms a significant part of the composition and sets the mood of the image. It is overcast, with heavy clouds in varying shades of gray and purple, implying an impending storm or challenging weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a sense of desolation and resilience, highlighting the stark beauty of nature in its more extreme forms. The angle of the shot, looking slightly upwards towards the sky, enhances the imposing presence of the trees and the vastness of the landscape.","title":"These trees were desTroyed by fire many years ago.","placename":"Rocky Mountain National Park (Colo.)","location":"Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado","nn1":["543722","543718","552551","546121","545747","555002","555207","555087","553572","555081","555105","554135","546065","543658","555103","544241"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["weather","storm","tree","desolation","resilience","condition","altitude","purple","remnant","shot"]}
