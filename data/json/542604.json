{"path":"542604.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a landscape dominated by a dense conifer forest under a bright, clear sky. This scene is set in a mountainous area, as evidenced by the rolling terrain and distant hills visible under a blue sky. The ground is uneven and covered in dry, brown soil with patches of grass and sparse foliage, indicating a possibly arid or summer season.\n\nTwo individuals can be seen amidst the trees; one is on the left side of the image slightly centered, and the other towards the middle right. They appear to be engaged in either walking through the terrain or possibly examining the area, as suggested by their postures and the presence of what looks like equipment or tools.\n\nThe trees are of varying sizes, with mature, towering conifers interspersed with smaller, younger saplings, suggesting an area of natural growth or reforestation. The shadows cast by the tall trees cover much of the ground, adding texture and a dynamic contrast to the scene.\n\nThe background is framed by a range of mountains, some of which have patches of snow, indicating their higher elevation and possibly a location in a region that experiences cold winters. Overall, the photograph portrays a tranquil and secluded natural environment, likely intended to depict either conservation efforts or a study of natural habitat.","title":"A typical selective-cut forest","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["548025","554461","554531","550602","555217","543569","557003","555147","543582","554459","545259","550535","555133","555114","550537","554400"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["conifer","conservation","study","elevation","patch","terrain","habitat","growth","effort","winter"]}
