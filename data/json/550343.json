{"path":"550343.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting with a large complex in the background and a cluttered, debris-filled foreground. The foreground is covered in what appears to be wood chips, logs, and assorted industrial waste. No human figures are visible, focusing the viewer's attention on the scenery itself.\n\nIn the middle ground, there are several pieces of heavy machinery, possibly used for processing or moving the materials seen in the foreground. A body of water is partially visible on the left side, suggesting that the industrial site may be near a lake or river.\n\nThe background features a large industrial complex with multiple structures, including silos, tall chimneys, and buildings with visible smoke and steam emissions. These emissions indicate that the facilities are active. The sky is overcast with gray clouds, adding a somber tone to the industrial activity.\n\nOverall, the composition has an almost bleak or desolate quality, emphasized by the scattered debris and the environmental impact inferred by the industrial emissions.","title":"Paper mill of Georgia Pacific Paper Company on the St. Croix River in Woodland.
