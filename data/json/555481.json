{"path":"555481.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a dramatic and intense scene involving a black car engulfed in large, vibrant flames, particularly fierce around the car's roof and windshield area. The fire is vivid, with hues of deep orange and red, suggesting an intense blaze. This conflagration seems to emit a significant amount of heat and smoke, visible as grey wisps around the brighter flames.\n\nIn the background, partially obscured by the fire and darkness of what could be either dusk or dawn, is a fire truck painted in bright red, marked with the number 4. This vehicle is equipped with standard fire-fighting gear, stationed there seemingly ready to address the blaze. The environment appears to be a paved area, likely a parking lot or a similar public space, with other indistinct elements and structures faintly visible in the background, softened by the lack of light or smoke.\n\nThis scene likely captures an emergency situation in progress, with the fire truck present indicating an ongoing response to the vehicular fire. The overall ambiance is tense and urgent, underscored by the stark contrast between the dark setting and the fiery illuminated forefront.","title":"Actual demonstration by the fire department training station showing what would happen after a rear end accident if a five gallon can of gasoline was carried in the trunk of an auto (picture number four in a series of six.)","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555480","555479","543002","555917","555160","543908","546373","543933","546017","543900","548854","543904","555482","557577","555156","553843"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["fire","flame","wisp","truck","engulf","statione","fiery","response","smoke","emergency"]}
