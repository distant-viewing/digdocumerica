{"path":"554858.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up portrait of an older man wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat. His features reflect an experienced and weathered expression. He has distinct facial wrinkles and a mature, thoughtful gaze. The man's dark eyes are slightly downcast, and his thick, age-grayed eyebrows add to his expressive face. A cigarette hangs from his lips, unlit.\n\nHe is wearing what appears to be a light-colored, possibly white jacket over a collared shirt. The background of the image is softly blurred, focusing attention solely on the man. The predominant color in the background is a deep red, which contrasts with the lighter, earthy tones of the man's hat and clothes. The composition of the photograph, with the man slightly off-center, enhances the intimate and candid feel of the portrait, suggesting a moment of quiet reflection or a brief pause in his day.","title":"Ranch hand who works in the area near Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554857","553115","547028","553091","556133","548251","548226","556478","544409","547007","548236","555529","542613","557173","552103","548218"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["portrait","man","lip","wrinkle","pause","hat","cigarette","straw","gaze","clothe"]}
