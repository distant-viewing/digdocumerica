{"path":"548381.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a hazy skyline view of a city during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the muted light and soft colors. In the foreground, an industrial facility with several large smokestacks, emitting white smoke, is prominently visible alongside the river. A large, riverboat-like structure, possibly a floating restaurant or casino, rests on the water near the industrial site.\n\nThe river cuts through the middle of the photo, reflecting the dim light and bordered by a wharf on the right side, where another large building stands. As the view extends to the background, the silhouette of a city skyline emerges through the haze, featuring a mix of high-rise buildings and towers.\n\nOne particular feature of note in the skyline is a pair of tall, dark, rectangular buildings, standing out due to their size and color contrast to the surrounding ambient light and shorter buildings. These towers, along with a varied collection of other high-rise structures, define the city's profile.\n\nA bridge, possibly a significant commuter artery, spans the river in the mid-distance, partially obscured by the haze and industrial smoke, connecting different parts of the city. The atmosphere of the scene suggests a typical morning or evening in a bustling, industrially active city, touched by air pollution, yet still grand in its urban scale and complexity.","title":"Looking across the east river to lower Manhattan.
