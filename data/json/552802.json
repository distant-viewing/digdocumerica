{"path":"552802.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This photograph depicts two men examining a small, bright yellow, wedge-shaped car in what appears to be a parking lot or an outdoor exhibit area. Both men are dressed in dark colors and seem to be focused on either inspecting or discussing the vehicle, which has its door open. The vehicle is designed in an unusual, compact form, possibly a concept or a custom car, and it features a minimalistic style common in futuristic or experimental auto designs.\n\nOne of the men, older, is bald and wearing glasses along with a dark suit and tie which suggests a formal or professional occasion. The other man, also dressed formally but in a less traditional manner with a padded jacket, is slightly hunched over as he looks into the car.\n\nIn the background, a group of people, some blurred in motion, can be seen, hinting at an event or gathering. A flag is partially visible, flying at half-mast on a flagpole, indicating a potential solemn or commemorative event coinciding with this scene. The flags contribute to a sense of occasion and formality.\n\nThe setting includes modern architectural elements and designates a public or semi-public space, evidenced by other vehicles and structural elements like metallic roofs and stone walls in the vicinity, giving a contemporary feel to the photograph. The dramatic clouds in the sky add a dynamic and somewhat moody atmosphere to the image.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the marriott motor inn, ann arbor vehicles and hardware were assembled at the epa ann arbor laboratory.
