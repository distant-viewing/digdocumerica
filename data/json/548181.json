{"path":"548181.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset over a river valley. The sun is positioned in the upper right quadrant of the image, hanging low in the sky and casting an orange and yellow glow that gradually transitions into deep blues and purples towards the top of the frame. The river meanders through the valley, reflecting the sunlight and appearing as a glowing, snaking pathway. Surrounding the river are rolling hills and ridges, which create a layered effect due to the atmospheric perspective, becoming progressively darker and more silhouetted as they recede into the distance. The entire scene is enveloped in a tranquil yet dramatic ambiance, typical of a sunset in a vast natural landscape. The photograph likely aims to evoke a sense of peace and the awe-inspiring beauty of nature.","title":"Columbia river gorge at sunrise, from an elevation of about 7,000 feet","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["548182","548904","548909","557447","553816","551206","547731","548910","557560","552294","542678","550646","554759","553844","552338","552277"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","valley","river","glowing","quadrant","aims","inspire","awe","envelo","recede"]}
