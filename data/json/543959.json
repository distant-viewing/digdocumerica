{"path":"543959.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a striking scene of a steamboat traveling on a body of water during twilight. The boat is large and multi-decked, adorned with rows of bright, shining lights that highlight its structure. The upper deck is visible and illuminated, and there are streams of smoke rising from two chimneys, suggesting the boat is powered by a steam engine. The lighting on the boat gives it a festive or celebratory look, contrasting with the dimming natural light of the surrounding environment.\n\nThe background shows a line of dark hills or forest silhouetted against the sunset sky, which gradually fades from shades of deep blue to lighter hues at the horizon. The water is relatively calm, reflecting some of the boat's lights, creating a shimmering effect on the surface. The perspective is from behind and slightly to the side of the steamboat, giving a view of the boat moving away into the dusky evening. This setting conveys a peaceful yet majestic evening voyage, combining elements of human engineering with natural beauty.","title":"Paddlewheel steamboat on Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543963","553815","543967","543955","543971","543962","543972","545917","543964","554658","545736","545921","543966","551222","551214","554657"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","evening","engine","engineering","twilight","stream","deck","steam","chimney","light"]}
