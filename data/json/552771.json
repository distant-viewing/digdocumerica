{"path":"552771.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant red vehicle with its hood open, revealing the engine and various components inside. The engine is painted green, contrasting strikingly with the red body of the car. It shows a neatly arranged engine bay with several metallic and rubber parts visible. Attached to the open hood is a white sign with black text, describing the vehicle as a \"Chrysler Low Emissions Vehicle.\" The sign provides technical details such as emission levels for hydrocarbons, CO, and NOx, mentioning the use of a \"1-141 Texaco Controlled Combustion System Engine (TCCS).\" It also highlights features like thermal reactor, internal stratified charge, regenerative gas heat exchanger, and an \"oxidation catalyist.\"\n\nThe background of the photograph is mostly unobtrusive, offering a glimpse of what appears to be a sunny day with a blue sky. There are no people visible in the photo, focusing all attention on the mechanical details and environmental technology being showcased. The setting suggests an outdoor setting, possibly at a car show or an exhibition given the professional display and focus on technical specifications.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the marriott motor inn, ann arbor vehicles and hardware were assembled at the epa ann arbor laboratory.
