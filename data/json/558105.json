{"path":"558105.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, autumnal outdoor setting. In the center and towards the right of the frame are several trees, their leaves showcasing various shades of green, yellow, and brown, suggesting it is either late autumn or early fall. The ground is thickly covered with fallen leaves, painting the grass underneath with hues of yellow, orange, and brown.\n\nOn the left side of the image, partially obscured by another tree and a hint of shadow, stands a simple, white house with a visible window and what appears to be a small, neighboring structure or shed beside it. The house and its surroundings are part of a peaceful rural or suburban area, as suggested by the ample greenery and absence of urban elements.\n\nToward the foreground, on the left side of the photo, you can see a person wearing a bright red jacket. They are facing sideways, standing with their body slightly leaning forward and their arms extended downward at an angle, possibly engaging in an activity like gardening or searching for something among the leaves.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is quiet and contemplative, possibly during a crisp, cool day, with a softly overcast sky that diffuses the light evenly across the scene. The composition conveys a sense of tranquility and the simple pleasures of outdoor activities in the midst of natureâ€™s seasonal change.","title":"Scientist from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History records data on Gleeson Mound, a Hopewell burial place dated 100 A.D.
