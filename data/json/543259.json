{"path":"543259.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic and scenic setting. In the foreground, there are large piles of neatly stacked lumber which dominate the right side of the image. The stacks vary in size and are arranged in multiple rows, showcasing different colors and conditions of wood, suggesting they are possibly ready for transport or usage.\n\nOn the left side of the image, near the lumber, stands a brown horse. It appears to be mid-sized and is glanced in the direction of the viewer, adding a lively element to the otherwise inanimate scene.\n\nThe middle ground of the photograph reveals a rugged dirt path that seems partially covered with white and yellow wildflowers. This path extends towards a beautiful backdrop featuring a coastal landscape. The coastline is visible in the distance, with sandy shores that curve gently into a calm body of water, possibly a river estuary or a sheltered bay. Hills or low mountains, lush with green vegetation, enclose the area, enhancing the picturesque and serene quality of the scene.\n\nThe atmosphere indicated by bright sunlight suggests a clear, vibrant day. The setting and composition of the photograph collectively portray a harmonious blend of industry and nature.","title":"California--near Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["542584","543489","542859","543541","555470","548162","544976","552163","550346","552162","542596","550668","554413","542956","545036","555134"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["lumber","path","usage","wildflower","horse","bay","coastline","stack","transport","direction"]}
