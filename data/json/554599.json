{"path":"554599.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene set in a natural and wild environment, featuring a woodchuck partially visible as it hides among leaf litter and boulders. The woodchuck, also known as a groundhog, is primarily visible in the center of the frame. Its fur blends with the colors of the surrounding dead leaves and earth, showcasing hues of brown and gray.\n\nThe background and foreground are cluttered with natural debris such as branches, dried leaves, and small green plants, emphasizing a natural woodland habitat. There is a prominent rock or boulder to the left side, lending texture and depth to the composition through its rugged surface. The lighting is natural, possibly dim forest light, contributing to the mood of quiet and seclusion.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of calm isolation and offers a snapshot of wildlife behavior in a natural setting.","title":"Woodchuck (Marmota monax) in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550472","543265","545564","550468","550470","545556","555668","542629","557615","542605","554598","551367","554607","551023","545560","558082"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["boulder","behavior","leave","fur","seclusion","leaf","litter","habitat","wildlife","snapshot"]}
