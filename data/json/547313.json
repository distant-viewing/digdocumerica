{"path":"547313.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man sitting on a low stool in front of a building with a window that reflects the sunny outdoor environment, adding light and depth to the composition. The man is dressed in rugged, casual workwear that includes blue denim overalls over a light blue shirt, and both are slightly stained, suggesting regular use in a work or outdoor setting. He also wears a striped engineer cap which complements his outfit.\n\nHis overalls have several interesting details, such as a visible pocket watch attached with a chain, contrasting with his practical, worn attire. He accessorizes further with dark rimmed glasses. The overalls are rolled up a bit at the ankles, revealing dark socks almost hidden by traditional, laced-up, heeled work boots that appear well-used and sturdy.\n\nThe elderly man holds a lit cigarette in one hand, resting between fingers tattooed by years of labor, adding character to his tough appearance. His expression is straightforward and no-nonsense, with a touch of weariness, possibly hinting at his life experiences.\n\nThe background behind him is neutral and unfocused, primarily showing the façade of the building with white walls and a dark trimmed window which features advertisements, including one for Pepsi. There’s a subtle reflection of the sunlit street scene in the window, creating a light, airy feel despite the man's stern demeanor.\n\nOverall, the image gives a sense of a moment paused, capturing the rugged dignity of an elderly man in a reflective or restful moment in a possibly rural or small-town setting. This is emphasized by the simplicity and authenticity of his attire and setting.","title":"Elderly citizen rests on bench on Main Street of Diller.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547330","549054","553090","547364","555529","552684","547355","547679","552523","547277","554926","548251","548218","554845","554858","556563"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["overall","man","ankle","workwear","engineer","stool","window","authenticity","watch","finger"]}
