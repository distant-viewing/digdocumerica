{"path":"553801.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a pastoral scene featuring a man standing in a field. He is dressed in a western outfit: a faded, patterned cowboy hat, a light gray button-up shirt, and blue jeans paired with mud-spattered boots. The man appears relaxed, standing with hands on his hips and his head turned to the side, pensively looking off into the distance.\n\nThe field itself is lush with greenery, hinting at early spring or late winter. In the foreground, a few small plants and dry grass clusters can be seen. The backdrop is spectacular, dominated by a long range of snow-capped mountains under a clear blue sky. This scenic panorama provides a stark contrast to the cultivated field and emphasizes the vast, open landscape.\n\nOverall, the scene is serene, evoking a sense of quiet solitude and the rugged beauty of rural life against the impressive backdrop of mountain peaks. The composition and natural lighting of the photograph enhance the contemplative mood conveyed by the manâ€™s posture and the expansive natural environment around him.","title":"Irrigated farm.
