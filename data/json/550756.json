{"path":"550756.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a visually striking and intimate moment between a man and a dog. The man, who appears to be middle-aged and shirtless, showing a lean physique, is interacting with a large, muscular brown dog that is standing on its hind legs, eagerly drinking water from a public drinking fountain. The man, adorned with a simple, casual wristwatch, is gently pressing down on a button at the top of the fountain, facilitating the stream of water, while attentively watching the dog drink.\n\nThe dog seems thirsty and keen, with its mouth close to the spout and its tongue visible, perhaps licking or catching the water. It wears a dark muzzle and is on a chain leash, suggesting it might be a breed perceived as strong or requiring careful handling. Its expression and posture convey eagerness and enjoyment of the refreshing water.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor grassy area, seemingly a park, with trees providing some dappled shade and a traditional, somewhat blurred, residential backdrop visible under bright daylight conditions. The drinking fountain itself is vintage in style, with a white, possibly metallic base and a single column supporting the basin which is also white. The concrete beneath their feet suggests that this area is well-used by park-goers.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a simple yet intimate interaction, highlighting companionship and care, surrounded by a peaceful, urban green space environment.","title":"One way to lick the dog days.
