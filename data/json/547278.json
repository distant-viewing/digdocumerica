{"path":"547278.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a blur of motion, presenting a scene likely from a children's party or a fairground attraction where young children and adults are riding on a carousel. The image's motion blur creates a dreamlike quality, accentuating the sense of movement and activity. The subjects, primarily children, are seated on carousel horses and are dressed in colorful outfits, possibly costumes or party attire, featuring skirts with hues like pink, blue, yellow, and green. These swift, swirling motions create an array of soft, blended colors throughout the image.\n\nThe background is indistinct due to the motion blur and low lighting, providing little detail about the specific location, but suggesting an indoor setting with possibly dim or ambient lighting. This type of setting enhances the ethereal and whimsical quality of the moment captured, focusing on the joy and dynamism of childhood play. The overall composition emphasizes this dynamism, with the circular movement of the ride and the blending colors of the children's attire contributing to a lively, festive atmosphere.","title":"Skirts whirl in the 33rd annual square dance festival, held in Pershing Auditorium.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["543213","549711","551297","547002","551298","551299","545458","547317","547270","551296","549111","549623","543093","547274","551295","551720"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["blur","dynamism","motion","child","fairground","costume","attraction","movement","childhood","ride"]}
