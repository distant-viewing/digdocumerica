{"path":"543315.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image presents a captivating view of what appears to be a swirling mass of sardines or other small, silvery fish in a deep blue marine environment. The fish create almost a fluid, dynamic pattern as they swim tightly together, likely as a defense mechanism against predators. The scene is underlit, suggesting that the light source is coming from below or from within the school itself, which highlights the silvery scales of the fish, making them sparkle against the dark water backdrop. Towards the right side of the image, there is a noticeable swirling formation, potentially a small whirlpool or vortex, around which the fish are densely packed. The dynamic interplay of light and movement gives this natural spectacle a sense of depth and vitality.","title":"California--Shell Beach Point","placename":"Shell Beach (Pismo Beach, Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553877","553878","548142","551364","546792","542892","555556","548713","546784","545075","543567","557496","548718","548677","546846","543189"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["fish","vitality","spectacle","mass","school","mechanism","source","interplay","formation","movement"]}
