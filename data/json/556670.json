{"path":"556670.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy scene at a train station. The main focus is on the sleek, metallic train that possesses a bold design with red, white, and blue accents, and paneled details reflecting an advanced, perhaps modern or futuristic build for its time. This train is parked beside a platform, where various passengers appear to be boarding or alighting from the coach visible in the image.\n\nOn the platform, the scene is lively with multiple passengers. The individuals are dressed in attire suitable for a professional or formal setting; for instance, men are seen wearing suits, some with long coats and ties, while a woman standing by the train door wears white, which might be a coat, paired with a dark handbag. The atmosphere captures a typical workday morning or evening rush, where people seem to be commuting possibly to or from work, focused on their day ahead or winding down.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it could be an overcast day, given the diffused and muted natural light that casts soft shadows around the figures and the train. The platform, covered with a roof, adds to the impression of a well-used, slightly crowded urban railway station environment, intensifying the essence of daily commuting hustle and bustle. The backdrop includes what appears to be other train tracks parallel to the one in the foreground, indicating that this station accommodates multiple railway lines.","title":"Amtrak passengers board a metroliner in a suburb near Washington, district of Columbia, for a trip to New York city.  It is one of the corporation's trains which make 16 round trips daily between the two cities, with four to five stops enroute.  Amtrak is trying to achieve a 55 per cent average load factor and is near the 50 percent figure at this time.  To achieve a much higher load factor the corporation would have to pack people in the trains during peak periods","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556026","555985","556855","555967","556673","556827","556074","555959","556846","556091","551889","556767","556774","556044","555984","551894"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","platform","station","railway","passenger","coat","commut","instance","commuting","white"]}
