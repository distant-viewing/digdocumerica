{"path":"544516.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a cattle egret standing in a shallow body of water surrounded by sparse aquatic grasses. The egret is mainly white with a distinct yellow beak, slightly opened as if mid-call or breathing. One of the egret's legs is visible, slightly bent, indicating a stance taken while wading through the water. Its eyes are open and directed forward, showing a focused or alert expression.\n\nThe background features a soft blue sky and hints of more water bodies or wetland areas, contributing to a tranquil yet vivid wildlife scene. The wisps of green aquatic plants in the foreground add a touch of color contrast against the egret's predominantly white feathers.\n\nThe overall composition has a naturalistic and detailed focus on the bird, with a blurred background that emphasizes its presence and activities within this wetland environment. The lighting appears natural, lending a vibrant clarity to the egret and its immediate surroundings.","title":"Cattle egret with breeding plumage","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544486","544478","544482","548732","545967","544842","544616","547745","544631","548729","544539","548731","544543","544620","547630","544489"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["egret","wetland","wisp","beak","cattle","feather","stance","clarity","bird","wildlife"]}
