{"path":"554339.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a man seated at a panel, likely during a conference or seminar. He appears somewhat reflective or attentive, posed with his chin resting on his hand. \n\nThe man is dressed in a dark blazer over what seems to be a patterned vest and a light-colored shirt. His dark hair is styled back and he has sideburns typical of styles from the mid-20th century. The lighting casts strong shadows on his face and on the surfaces around him, suggesting an indoor setting with stage or spot lighting.\n\nHe is sitting behind a long table, which has a nameplate reading “GEEL HUMPHREYS” propped in front of him, indicating this might be either his name or the name of another speaker or participant scheduled to use this spot. On the table, a microphone is positioned directly in front of him, suggesting that he is a speaker or panelist waiting for or listening to a question, or preparing to speak.\n\nThe background is minimally visible, showing only a plain light-colored backdrop which provides a stark contrast to the dark foreground where the man and the objects on the table are situated. This setup puts a significant focus on the individual and the immediate space around him.","title":"Participant in a citizens' forum held in Midtown Manhattan to discuss transportation problems and clean air strategies for New York City proposed by EPA's regional office.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549114","557703","554322","545471","546550","554333","547367","553030","556271","557317","554338","554342","555297","544069","553087","558393"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["speaker","table","spot","name","question","schedule","put","microphone","chin","prop"]}
