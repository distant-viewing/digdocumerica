{"path":"547907.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a polluted and neglected environment. In the forefront, a vast accumulation of garbage lines the banks of a narrow waterway. Among the debris, one can see a variety of discarded items including tires, wooden pallets, rusted barrels, and miscellaneous household trash such as paper boxes and plastic containers.\n\nThe water itself contains more floating trash and has several vertical wooden poles protruding from its surface, suggesting remnants of a structure or dock that was once functional. The water appears stagnant and polluted, reflecting the grey sky above.\n\nIn the background, a large industrial building with twin chimneys looms over the scene, indicating proximity to an industrial area. The structure of the plant is stark and utilitarian, with visible pipes on the exterior.\n\nThe overall scene is desolate and devoid of any human presence or natural life, emphasizing a sense of environmental degradation and neglect. The composition effectively captures the impact of industrial waste and poor environmental management practices on nature.","title":"Channel choked with wastes at the municipal incineration plant at gravesend bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551440","551562","544810","550800","550352","547897","547485","546785","546854","547524","552019","551559","552127","552811","550812","543762"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pollute","trash","neglect","pallet","twin","wooden","discarded","household","protrud","loom"]}
