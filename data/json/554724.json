{"path":"554724.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a scenic yet somewhat industrial landscape, characterized by a striking contrast between natural beauty and human activity. The upper portion of the image is dominated by a dense forest exhibiting a myriad of autumn colorsâ€”ranging from deep greens to vibrant oranges, yellows, and reds. This rich mosaic suggests that the photo was taken during the fall.\n\nIn the lower part of the image, the setting shifts to a more industrial scene. There is a large excavation site with multiple layers and sections of exposed earth, varying in color from dark grey to lighter shades of brown. The terrain here is rugged and uneven, with piles of excavated materials and several dirt tracks evident throughout the site, suggesting recent or ongoing activity. A few heavy vehicles, possibly related to construction or mining, are stationed at various positions within the excavation area, appearing small against the vast landscape.\n\nSeparating these two main areas is a road or path lined with utility or telephone poles, providing a subtle hint at human presence and infrastructure amidst the predominantly natural locale. The scene captures a compelling narrative about the interaction between human endeavors and the natural environment, presenting a visual dialogue about usage, impact, and coexistence.","title":"Typical excavation site for sand and gravel in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["550573","551204","556913","544438","549255","550568","556935","555752","544498","550572","550753","547098","556977","554811","553051","542834"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["excavation","dialogue","myriad","site","telephone","shift","locale","usage","endeavor","coexistence"]}
