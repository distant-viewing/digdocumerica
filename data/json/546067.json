{"path":"546067.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking industrial scene set in a serene and wooded river environment. The main focus of the image is a large, rusted, metal structure positioned on the water, appearing to be a part of an old, disused mechanism possibly related to river control or industrial operations.\n\nThe structure is large, constructed from heavy metal beams forming a lattice, with some elements resembling a crane or lift system. It has several tiers and surfaces, which look worn and weathered, suggesting it has been exposed to the elements for quite some time. There are additional building parts attached to it, including what could be platforms or control rooms, all featuring a similar state of deterioration and rust.\n\nThe river on which this structure stands is calm, reflecting the structure and the blue sky above impeccably. This water body appears quite wide, bordered by dense trees on both sides which are richly colored in hues of green, indicating the photo was taken during spring or summer. The presence of floating debris and vegetation on the water surface adds a natural and somewhat neglected aspect to the scene.\n\nThe background is composed mainly of trees in various shades of green, and the clear sky contributes to a peaceful overall atmosphere, in contrast with the aged and abandoned mechanical construct. This juxtaposition between nature and industrial activity creates a poignant, almost melancholic reflection on perhaps a once bustling site now quiet and overrun by natural elements.","title":"An abandoned drilling rig in the Bayou Segnette approximately five miles from the Westwego public boat launch.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["551533","547579","553393","555730","547890","553462","547519","552240","558003","545982","543258","557377","556351","554565","551519","549555"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["construct","control","river","tier","deterioration","lattice","green","mechanism","lift","metal"]}
