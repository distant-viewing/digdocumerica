{"path":"553305.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of musicians performing in a nighttime setting, illuminated by what appears to be soft, artificial lighting. The scene captures four visible musicians, mostly in formal attire, engaged in playing their instruments. From left to right, thereâ€™s a guitarist, two trumpet players, and another brass instrument player, potentially a trombone player whose motion is blurred suggesting movement.\n\nMusic sheets are visible in front of the musicians, indicating a structured performance possibly of classical or jazz music. The lighting casts a warm glow on their faces and the music sheets, enhancing the atmosphere of an intimate live music performance. The background is predominantly dark with hints of foliage, suggesting the performance might be outdoors, in a park or garden at night. The overall composition and motion blur add a sense of dynamism and immediacy to the image, capturing the essence of a live musical performance.","title":"D'aug days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, fountain square.
