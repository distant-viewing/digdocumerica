{"path":"550244.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a young child playing at the edge of a water body, likely the sea or a lake. The child is kneeling on dark, wet sand, deeply immersed in playing with a bright green and yellow toy truck. The child appears to be focused on pushing or maneuvering the toy truck through the shallow water washing up on the beach. The incoming water forms a small wave that lightly breaks near the child, further saturating the dark sand around.\n\nThe child, who has light-colored hair, is shirtless and probably wearing swim shorts, although they are not clearly visible in the photo. This image emphasizes a playful and perhaps nostalgic scene of childhood activities at the beach. The background is simple and mostly composed of the sandy beach and water, creating a serene and focused frame around the child and their engagement with the environment and the toy. The lighting seems natural, suggesting this photo was taken outdoors on a cloudy day or in a shaded area, giving the colors a more muted tone.","title":"Serious play at Huntington Beach on Lake Erie.
