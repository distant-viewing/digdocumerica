{"path":"557525.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rural, hilly landscape that gently descends towards a coastline. The view includes a prominent electrical power line structure in the foreground. The structure is metallic and carries multiple wires stretching across the frame. The power line passes over undulating terrain, covered with sparse vegetation and scattered bushes, suggesting a rough, possibly coastal environment.\n\nIn the distance, the coastline curves into a bay with a visible strip of water that meets a haze-filled sky, indicating a wide, expansive view possibly taken during early morning or late afternoon. The light and color in the image are muted, with blue and green hues dominating, enhanced by the slight haze that gives a soft, pastel quality to the scene.\n\nThis vantage point not only highlights human technological intervention in a natural landscape but also offers a sweeping view of the natural beauty of the coastline, suggesting a juxtaposition between human activity and nature. The overall composition of the image, with its alignment of power lines receding into the background, draws the viewerâ€™s gaze across the diverse textures and forms of the landscape towards the distant ocean.","title":"Signs of civilization loom over the santa monica mountains near Malibu, California, on the northern edge of Los Angeles.  These mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles county but are under threat of development.  Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure.  Shoreline development has been restricted since the passage of the coastal zone conservation act in november, 1972","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543728","557977","549110","542643","544355","550753","544695","542895","545050","555574","546054","555609","549011","554052","558107","549135"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["power","coastline","haze","alignment","intervention","descend","line","recede","pass","undulate"]}
