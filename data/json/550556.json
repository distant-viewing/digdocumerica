{"path":"550556.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a landscape that shows a mix of urban and natural features. Here's a breakdown of the various elements in the image:\n\n1. **Urban Areas**: The image captures a large expanse of urban development. There are clusters of buildings of varying sizes, forms, and configurations. Some industrial-looking complexes with large flat roofs can be seen, suggesting facilities like warehouses or manufacturing plants.\n\n2. **Road System**: A prominent feature is the sophisticated road network visible in different parts of the photo. Major roads, possibly highways, can be seen crisscrossing the area, linking different parts of the town with what seems to be an airport in the farther distance where the runway is discernible.\n\n3. **Natural Landscapes**: Surrounding the urban areas are vast tracks of dense greenery, predominantly forest. The natural landscape serves as a contrasting backdrop to the human-made structures, providing a boundary between the developed and undeveloped land.\n\n4. **Airport**: At the upper part of the image, there is what appears to be an airport given the visible runways. There are also several large structures and parking areas nearby, indicative of airport terminals and support facilities.\n\n5. **Composition**: The photograph is taken from a high altitude, looking down diagonally across the landscape, giving a comprehensive view of how the urban environment integrates with the natural surroundings. The mix of greenery with urban developments offers a dynamic visual contrast.\n\nThis aerial shot encapsulates a balance between urban expansion and preserved natural areas, illustrating typical features of a suburban to semi-urban municipality that has grown around a central transportation hub like an airport.","title":"University of Alaska in the lower foreground, downtown Fairbanks in the upper distance.
