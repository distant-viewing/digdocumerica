{"path":"553255.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a striking night-time scene of a modern office building with a facade made up largely of deep blue and gray vertical elements. The building features a grid of rectangular columns and window frames, coated in a reflective material that catches minimal ambient light, thus contributing to the image's predominantly dusky hue. A few windows emit a soft, greenish glow, which creates a subtle contrast against the building’s mostly dark exterior.\n\nOne window in particular stands out with a brighter yellow illumination. Within this lit space, you can see the silhouette of a person. The individual appears to be standing and facing the window, their outline crisply defined against the lighted background — a stark, almost solitary figure in an otherwise uniform architectural environment.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is somewhat isolated and contemplative, possibly highlighting themes like urban solitude or personal reflection amid the sprawling anonymity of a modern metropolis. The use of color and light accentuates a sense of quietude and introspection, making the solitary human presence even more poignant.","title":"August brings the \"d'aug days\" to fountain square, \"d'aug days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people, late worker in the du bois tower looks out at the gathering crowd in the square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["546546","555426","550123","549880","546506","555736","546470","550011","542802","550007","553220","546531","549490","549493","549864","555419"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["window","metropolis","anonymity","introspection","quietude","light","illumination","night","grid","define"]}
