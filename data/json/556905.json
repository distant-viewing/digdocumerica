{"path":"556905.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This is an aerial photograph capturing a serene landscape dominated by a large body of water. The image is framed with thick, dense forests along the edges, suggesting it is taken in a remote or less urbanized area. In the water, there are several boats; two larger vessels, possibly ferries or barges, are prominent while a few smaller boats can be seen near the shore.\n\nA curved road hugs the shoreline, bending around the contour of the land, and it appears to be a major roadway given its width and clear demarcation. Alongside the road, near the bottom of the image, is a cluster of buildings or structures with white and gray rooftops, potentially indicative of a small industrial or commercial facility. This area includes a parking lot filled with vehicles, suggesting some human activity, though no people are directly visible.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is diffused, likely taken either early in the morning or later in the afternoon given the soft shadows and the overall muted tones of the environment. The image overall conveys a tranquil, somewhat isolated moment, capturing both human technology's interaction with the natural environment and the quiet beauty of the landscape.","title":"Aerial view looking southwest at hood canal frontage at the navy's banger annex.
