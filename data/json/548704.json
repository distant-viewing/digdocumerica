{"path":"548704.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic natural scene, most likely at a coastal location. The focus is on a large body of shallow water, displaying a beautiful gradient of aquamarine colors. The water is crystal clear, revealing the sandy bottom and some aquatic vegetation near the foreground. Overhead, the sky is dominated by a heavy, dynamic cloud formation ranging from dark stormy blues to lighter grays, suggesting an approaching storm or recent weather disturbance.\n\nThe horizon is visible towards the upper third of the image, with a thin, nearly flat line dividing the sea and sky. The lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, given the muted natural tones and the soft diffused light. There are no people or man-made structures visible; the scene is entirely natural and untouched, evoking a sense of tranquility mixed with the impending force of nature due to the stormy sky. The composition of the photo, with its large expanse of water under the brooding sky, creates a serene yet somewhat moody atmosphere.","title":"A stormy sky gives the camera a clear view of the clouds of silt in the waters off Saddle Bunch Keys in the Lower Florida Keys. Silt occurs naturally in the formation of coral reefs, but the amount shown here could only be produced by the extensive dredging of the land developers.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548754","548705","555803","543138","547047","557814","550391","555713","552916","554002","547057","551573","555396","543025","547638","543049"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["crystal","overhead","third","storm","disturbance","force","gradient","gray","bottom","water"]}
