{"path":"546671.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This aerial photograph showcases an urban landscape featuring a mix of parking lots and buildings. The scene is densely packed with several interesting elements:\n\n1. **Parking Lots and Vehicles**: The foreground and midground are dominated by large, open parking areas filled with numerous vehicles. The cars are closely parked, displaying a variety of colors which add a contrasting visual element to the grey asphalt of the parking lots.\n\n2. **Buildings**: There are several buildings in the picture, varying in size and architecture. On the left side, there is a large multi-storey building that appears to be either an office or an industrial facility. In the middle of the image, near another parking lot, stands a construction site with what looks like the foundations of a new structure and construction machinery. Toward the right, there are more conventional, possibly residential or office buildings, characterized by their brick construction and flat roofs.\n\n3. **Vegetation and Surroundings**: Around the perimeter of the urban area, there are patches of green space, which provide a visual break from the dense urban layout. There are trees lining some of the streets, and a larger green area can be observed in the top left corner of the photograph.\n\n4. **Streets and Accessibility**: The area is crisscrossed by several streets, allowing vehicle access to the buildings and parking lots. These streets help define the grid layout typical of urban planning.\n\nThe imaging perspective provides a detailed overview of a bustling urban area, emphasizing its functional aspects, such as transportation and infrastructure, while also highlighting the ongoing development and utilization of space in an urban setting.","title":"Roof parking in downtown Washington","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546715","546708","546579","548434","549875","549476","546723","548359","547764","546617","543961","551506","548364","548433","546616","546699"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["parking","lot","construction","office","layout","street","streets","building","foundation","perimeter"]}
