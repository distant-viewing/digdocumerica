{"path":"548274.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly woman standing on an underground subway platform. The station appears somewhat dimly lit but has overhead fluorescent lights that illuminate sections of the platform. The woman is dressed in a classic, dark coat that reaches mid-calf, and she wears a matching dark hat. Her sturdy shoes and the purse she carries suggest a functional, possibly daily commute or travel. She is looking to her left, perhaps in anticipation of an arriving train, which provides a sense of waiting or expectancy in the image.\n\nThe surroundings are characteristic of many subway stations with utilitarian, sturdy columns painted in a dark color supporting the ceiling. The platform itself is empty except for the woman, enhancing the feeling of solitude. The visible signs, labeled \"79\" hint at the stationâ€™s name or its sequence along the subway line, suggesting this might be in an urban setting. The background shows the parallel lines of the train tracks retreating into the darker parts of the station, while safety railings line the edge of the platform, ensuring commuter safety. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet and calm, punctuated by the anticipation and routine of urban transit.","title":"A woman waits for a train at the 79th street station","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556662","556663","556821","548257","551889","556682","548259","556818","556660","549675","551894","556651","548254","556774","548255","556665"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","platform","station","anticipation","train","safety","sequence","woman","commute","arrive"]}
