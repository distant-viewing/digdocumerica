{"path":"550969.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a striking industrial scene taken from a street-level perspective, focusing primarily on a factory backdrop with multiple tall smokestacks emitting plumes of smoke. The scene occurs in what appears to be an urban setting, assumed from the industrial buildings and structures densely packed in the background.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a distinctive urban element: a street sign that reads \"South Charleston 'The City with a future.'\" The sign is attached to a post with a rounded, dark-colored object on top which might be a lamp or part of the sign mechanism. This message contrasts interestingly with the industrial-heavy landscape it faces.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo is occupied by a street busy with vehicle activity. Several cars of different make and models typical of the late 20th century are visible, emphasizing the everyday nature and bustling atmosphere of this area.\n\nThis photograph serves as a document of the industrial aspect of South Charleston and includes an implicit message about the city's vision of progress, juxtaposed with the environmental impact visible through the smoke and industrialization in the background.","title":"Trash basket on sidewalk.
