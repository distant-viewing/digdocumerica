{"path":"544723.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a moment on a busy highway, likely taken in the mid to late 20th century based on the style of the vehicles. The scene is set against a backdrop that features a flat, expansive industrial area with several large factory buildings visible in the distance. The skyline is barely discernible against a hazy sky, suggesting either fog, smog, or dusty air, which leans towards an industrial or urban environment.\n\nIn the foreground, the highway is filled with cars that signify the era, with designs typical of the 1960s or 1970s. There are at least four visible cars â€“ a pink station wagon, a blue sedan, a yellow sedan, and a blue larger model possibly an early sedan or station wagon. The colors of the vehicles are quite vivid and add a pop to the visual field dominated by the drab industrial background and brownish hues of the open field beside the highway.\n\nRoad signage is visible indicating exits for \"Fremont Blvd 1/2\" and \"Dixon Landing 3 3/4\", providing a hint at the geographic setting of the photograph. The highway itself is divided, with multiple lanes in both directions, and a physical barrier between the opposite flows of traffic. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph provides a slice of life from a past era, highlighting both the style of automobiles of the time and the type of sprawling, industrial landscapes that were common at the outskirts of American cities.","title":"California--near San Francisco Bay","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["545463","557230","545455","555437","550182","549890","547651","550089","542764","553019","547811","545432","548084","555505","549857","545884"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","sedan","wagon","station","era","smog","pop","past","exit","field"]}
