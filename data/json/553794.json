{"path":"553794.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photo captures a somewhat dimly lit scene, likely in an urban setting, featuring a man in the foreground who is exiting a vehicle or structure. The man is dressed in a black shirt and trousers, wearing a cap, and is looking slightly off-camera with a neutral expression. He is carrying a bicycle next to him, which adds to the urban, commuter vibe of the image.\n\nBehind him, there is a hint of background activity with other people who appear to be seated and standing. The environment includes a steel structure, possibly part of a ferry or a public transport vessel, which suggests a transit hub or terminal. The sky is visible in the background, showing patches of blue and clouds, indicating it might be a partly cloudy day.\n\nThe overall composition has a candid, documentary feel, catching a moment of everyday movement and travel, emphasizing urban life and public transportation.","title":"\"Sea Transit\" ferry has been operating for one year between downtown Honolulu and Pearl Harbor - an alternative to freeway congestion. It also carries military-related employees across Pearl Harbor to the parking lot - saving them a 45-minute drive. Some passengers complete their trip on bicycles.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["547821","556021","547748","552971","545351","551816","549277","547389","547695","548373","551975","556823","557913","555433","545331","549867"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["documentary","ferry","terminal","commuter","exit","bicycle","hub","transit","steel","vibe"]}
