{"path":"554981.jpg","date":"March 1967","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a dark, nocturnally themed scene focusing on a grove of leafless trees. The branches of the trees are highlighted by a light source, possibly moonlight or artificial lighting, which creates a striking contrast against the deep, dark blue or black background. The trees vary in size and height, but all share a similar bare, skeletal appearance — their branches intricately webbed and extending outward and upward.\n\nThe lighting specially illuminates the edges and contours of the branches, bringing out their delicate and intricate patterns; this results in an ethereal, almost silver-lined visualization of each tree. The composition is dense with these tree structures, and no clear sky or ground can be discerned from the image, giving the impression that the viewer is enveloped by this ghostly forest.\n\nThe image does not include any visible signs of human or animal activity; it’s solely focused on showcasing the natural elements of these trees in a serene, yet somewhat eerie atmosphere. The overall mood of the image is quiet and otherworldly, emphasizing the natural forms and their interaction with light in darkness.","title":"Alder with buds at Green Mountain in Kitsap County, Washington, near Seattle","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557579","555112","554395","553580","553579","543621","554994","553575","553620","547705","554979","553578","555002","553574","555122","543021"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["branch","tree","silver","result","discern","bring","darkness","share","source","envelop"]}
