{"path":"557456.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a newly constructed residential street, showing signs of ongoing or recent development. The road is cleanly paved and includes white markings at the edges, though it is devoid of any vehicular or pedestrian traffic. On both sides of the street, there are sidewalks parallel to the curb, and several turquoise-colored street lamps are evenly spaced, adding a designed element to the neighborhood.\n\nThe immediate surroundings of the road consist of rough, barren landscapes, suggesting recent excavation or land clearing activities. This terrain is uneven and mostly devoid of vegetation, dominated by exposed earth that has been dug up and piled into mounds. Sparse greenery can be observed, suggesting the arid or semi-arid climate of the area.\n\nIn the background, there are a few houses that appear to be either newly built or in the final stages of construction. These houses are large, multi-storied, and feature prominent balconies and large windows. They exhibit a modern architectural style with flat roofs, and their elevated position on the terrain provides them with a commanding view of the surroundings.\n\nAt the top of the hill, behind the houses, power lines and poles can be seen, suggesting the presence of basic utilities being set up for residential use.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the initial stages of a residential area's development, highlighting both the construction efforts and the barren yet developing landscape.","title":"Unfinished streets and utilities contrast with completed development in the background at Laguna Niguel. Work here was halted and other developments were restricted following state passage of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November, 1972. State and regional regulatory commissions must present a final report to the legislature by January, 1976, recommending passage of laws affecting future coastal development.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["547931","547863","553061","547664","544629","557455","553693","547652","553707","557550","553125","544814","546765","557461","544604","552031"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["house","stage","street","development","construction","surrounding","curb","marking","balcony","clearing"]}
