{"path":"553469.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a view through a grassy park towards a distant urban skyline. In the foreground, the grass is a vibrant green, and a person is partially visible, walking from right to left. The individual appears to be wearing a dark jacket and pants, with their back to the viewer.\n\nTwo large trees frame the image; one on the left with a split trunk and another on the right whose branches stretch across the top-right corner of the frame, both casting shadows and adding a dappled light effect on the ground. Between these trees, several buildings of different architectural styles and heights can be seen, signifying a cityscape. The buildings are varied in design, ranging from historic, with traditional features and ornate embellishments, to more modern, stark structures.\n\nThe sky is a clear blue, suggesting a bright, sunny day. The overall composition beautifully contrasts the natural, serene setting of the park with the bustling, constructed environment of the city in the background, offering a narrative of coexistence between urban development and green spaces.","title":"Mulky Square is a neighborhood in the west side of Kansas City, an area of low-income dwellings.
