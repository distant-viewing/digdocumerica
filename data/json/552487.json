{"path":"552487.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, somewhat somber setting in a cemetery. The central focus is a tree with its leaves turning brown, suggesting either the onset of autumn or a possible ailment affecting the tree. The background is populated with dense green foliage and several traditional tombstones, adding to the reverence of the scene. Notable is a large monument in the background, standing taller than the surrounding grave markers, which are simpler and lower to the ground.\n\nThe lighting is softened by speckles of sunlight filtering through the tree branches, casting dappled shadows over the area and illuminating parts of the grassy ground. The overall mood is quiet and contemplative, typical of a cemetery environment which invites reflection and remembrance. The composition balances elements of life and decay, symbolized by the healthy and dying parts of the tree, and the juxtaposition of lush greenery with the concept of a resting place for the deceased.","title":"Cemetery in Jubilee Park","placename":"Kickapoo (Ill.)","location":"Kickapoo, Illinois","nn1":["554824","554790","552451","557184","558040","552017","554792","550731","557089","557942","547420","550364","557185","547417","550365","547337"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cemetery","concept","tombstone","remembrance","die","reverence","onset","monument","symbolize","speckle"]}
