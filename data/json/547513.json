{"path":"547513.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph presents a scene of environmental degradation, capturing a collection of discarded items submerged in a body of water amid natural vegetation. In the forefront, a prominent feature is a deteriorating cardboard box with the phrase \"LIGHTS INSANITY\" visible, suggesting it once contained light bulbs or related electrical items. Surrounding the box are various other pieces of trash, including water-soaked papers, torn fragments of cardboard, and other unidentifiable debris that contribute to the overall sense of pollution.\n\nThe background is filled with dense, dark aquatic plants, likely reeds or rushes, which rise vertically and appear slightly blurred, indicating a shallow depth of field focused on the garbage in the water. The water itself appears stagnant, with its surface partly covered by a film or sheen, possibly indicating the presence of oils or other pollutants.\n\nThe scene is a stark depiction of environmental neglect, illustrating how natural areas can become dumping grounds for waste, leading to contamination and potential ecological damage. The lighting and composition further emphasize the somber and neglected mood, with natural light casting shadows and highlighting the textures of the wet, discarded items.","title":"The Middletown dump spills over to the adjacent salt marsh.
