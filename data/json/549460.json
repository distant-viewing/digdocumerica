{"path":"549460.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a serene river landscape. In the foreground, a grassy slope dotted with scattered rocks can be seen descending towards the riverbank. The river itself is a deep, quiet body of water reflecting the blue of the sky. In the middle of the river, two rafts with multiple passengers are floating gently. Each raft appears to be an inflatable boat, and the passengers, visible but not detailed, seem to be engaged in leisure activities, possibly navigating or conversing.\n\nThe backdrop includes a rugged terrain of rocky hillsides with an arid appearance. These steep, craggy formations surrounding the river are mostly barren, with very sparse vegetation. The hills are imposing and form a stark contrast with the calmness of the water.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a tranquil outdoor recreational scene set against a dramatic natural landscape, emphasizing a sense of adventure and peaceful coexistence with the rugged environment.","title":"Rafts on a quiet stretch of the snake river in hells canyon part of the Idaho-Oregon border.
