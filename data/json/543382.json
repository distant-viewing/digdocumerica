{"path":"543382.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of five hikers traversing a rocky mountain terrain. The environment is sparse and rocky, with no visible vegetation, highlighting the high-altitude context of the scene. Each hiker is equipped with backpacks and hiking gear; some are using walking sticks to aid their trek. They appear to be walking in a line diagonally across the frame from the lower left to the upper right, engaging with the challenging landscape.\n\nThe weather conditions seem foggy or misty, as the background features a faded, obscured atmosphere that limits visibility and creates a sense of isolation or remoteness. This adds a mysterious or adventurous mood to the photo. The sky is overcast, with no clear delineation between sky and land in the distance due to the fog.\n\nClothing and gear suggest that the hike might be taking place during a cooler season or that the altitude requires such attire for warmth and protection. The hikers display a sense of determination or focus, enhancing the depiction of this activity as demanding yet rewarding.\n\nThe image might be from an old film camera, indicated by noticeable grain and potential specks or slight scratches on the image, contributing to a vintage feel. The overall composition of the photograph, with its dynamic diagonal arrangement of subjects against a rugged landscape and obscured horizon, emphasizes themes of adventure, exploration, and the natural challenge posed by a mountain environment.","title":"Explorer post 397 of Los Angeles area back - packing to Mineral King Wilderness","placename":"Monarch Lakes (Calif.)","location":"Monarch Lakes, California","nn1":["543510","544305","543385","554508","554505","554503","545700","543383","543381","554507","543387","554558","554504","554509","543375","554672"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiker","altitude","gear","delineation","determination","hike","scratch","remoteness","speck","stick"]}
