{"path":"556860.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a railway track where maintenance or loading activities are taking place. The setting is outdoors, and the environment suggests a temperate climate with trees showing autumn colors in the background.\n\nTwo individuals are visible in the photograph. One, appearing to the left, is mostly obscured and seems to be working on some equipment attached to the railway car. This person is wearing a long-sleeve plaid shirt and jeans. On the right, another individual in a light-colored long-sleeve shirt and darker pants is bending over, handling some kind of tool or part near the track. Both wear protective helmets, suggesting a focus on safety in their activities.\n\nIn the scene, there is a long train composed of several cars. The sides of the nearest cars are dark-colored with minimal detailing, except for the visible word \"SOUTHERN\" on one of the cars, indicating the railway line or company. The cars have a sleek design, reflective of passenger train models.\n\nForeground elements include railway tracks and gravel, emphasizing the industrial nature of the setting. Various mechanical components and machinery, which seem to be part of the train or maintenance equipment, fill the left side of the image. These pieces of equipment look complex, with visible cables, wheels, and other mechanical parts.\n\nThe background is fairly muted but shows a blend of greens from trees and gray sky, indicating either early morning, late afternoon, or overcast weather conditions. The lines of the train and tracks draw the eye into the depth of the image, suggesting an expansive setting. This scenario reflects active, hands-on work, possibly concerning train maintenance or preparation for movement.","title":"Southern Railway track repair crew removes old rails and replaces them with new quarter mile long rails in a regular program to improve the company's 10,531 miles of track. On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to halt work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded track per day. The crew numbers 50 to 55 men, and Southern has an average of four working throughout the system.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556872","556869","556862","556887","556881","556861","556901","556871","556883","556874","556859","556897","556898","556889","556899","556875"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["train","railway","track","car","maintenance","equipment","sleeve","loading","company","detailing"]}
