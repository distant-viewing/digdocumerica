{"path":"550532.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a landscape predominantly covered with dense green forest. A significant human-made clearing can be seen in the midst of this forest, including several dirt roads that intersect and lead to different parts of the area. Within these clearings are three main sites where activities appear to be concentrated:\n\n1. **Top Left Section:** This site includes a large cleared area with dirt visible, suggesting recent or ongoing construction or land alteration. A few structures and vehicles are visible, scattered across the area, indicating possible industrial or construction activities.\n\n2. **Center Left:** This area hosts a cluster of structures that resemble a small complex, possibly a temporary or permanent work camp. There are what appear to be several trailers or modular buildings arranged in a systematic layout, possibly for accommodation or office use.\n\n3. **Bottom right of Center:** This site also features modular buildings arranged in a clear pattern, similar to the central left site, suggesting a purpose related to work or housing.\n\nThe roads are broad and distinctly cut through the forest, likely facilitating movement of vehicles and equipment between the different sites and possibly linking to other locations outside the frame. The natural landscape surrounding these developments is untouched in vast stretches, highlighting the isolated nature of human activities in this region.","title":"View west toward site of pump station #5.
