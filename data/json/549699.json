{"path":"549699.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a group of historical reenactors in a Revolutionary War-era military formation. Roughly a dozen men are featured prominently in the image, marching in two parallel lines. They are dressed in period military uniforms, predominantly beige and white with black hats, some with red accents on the lapels and cuffs. They also wear white knee breeches and black boots.\n\nEach reenactor carries a long musket or rifle, held vertically, and one person in the front line holds a red flag mounted on a pole. Their expressions are serious, maintaining a disciplined military demeanor.\n\nThe setting is a sunny day, and the activity takes place on a lush green lawn, suggesting a park or preserved historical site. In the background, traditional wooden buildings painted white can be seen, adorned with American flags and colonial-era decorations, emphasizing the historical context of the reenactment.\n\nPeople dressed in other historical costumes observe from the sidelines, further adding to the immersive feel of the scene. There's also a hint of a modern audience on the right edge of the image, which might be contemporary visitors watching the reenactment. Trees and blue sky suggest a pleasant, clear day, making it ideal for such outdoor activities.","title":"Old time Rifleman's meet, june 24, 1973, on the greenfield village green adjoining the henry ford museum of dearborn.
