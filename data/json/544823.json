{"path":"544823.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph shows a landscape cluttered with various pieces of waste and debris, predominantly composed of paper materials and ruined fabric. A worn, red piece of fabric is particularly conspicuous among the litter. The scene is fenced off by a wire mesh fence that appears to be somewhat damaged and bent, held up by tall wooden poles that have weathered considerably, showing signs of damage and degradation. The ground beneath the fence and the debris is uneven and covered with a mix of dry grass and soil, indicative of an arid environment. \n\nIn the background, the area extends into more waste-covered ground leading towards a horizon under a clear blue sky. There are distant buildings or structures barely visible, suggesting that this dump site might be on the outskirts of a populated area. The overall tone of the image portrays neglect and environmental degradation, highlighting the issue of waste management and its ecological impact. The composition and angle give a sense of both confinement, due to the fence, and vastness because of the open sky and stretch of land.","title":"Trash often blows over fences around Jefferson County's open dump and lands miles away.","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["550798","550801","557307","552446","544799","549747","547983","549750","549957","544637","551247","551245","553433","543165","548210","556640"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["waste","fence","fabric","degradation","piece","dump","mesh","debris","litter","stretch"]}
