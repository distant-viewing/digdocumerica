{"path":"552697.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This image captures a serene winter landscape, predominantly covered in snow. In the foreground, there's a mule deer, characterized by its large ears resembling those of a mule. The deer is positioned on the left side of the frame, facing to the right, and is partly in motion, with one of its front legs lifted as if in mid-step. The deer's fur is a blend of gray and brown, which contrasts subtly with the white snow.\n\nThe background features a gently undulating terrain covered with a blanket of snow. Sparse vegetation, likely dried grass or shrubs, protrudes through the snow at various points across the landscape, adding a touch of rough texture and a hint of color differentiation from the overwhelming white. The sky is overcast, casting a diffused light which enhances the chilly, wintry ambiance of the scene.\n\nThe composition of the photograph suggests a quiet, cold day, possibly with a slight breeze as indicated by the small drifts and uneven surface of the snow. The image might convey a sense of isolation or the tranquility of a snowy day in a natural habitat, emphasizing themes of survival and adaptation in winter conditions.","title":"Winter storm leaves hungry deer to seek food at a ranch near Piceance Creek","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["558368","544571","545898","545902","543279","549219","554621","544916","544623","544914","542778","552558","542955","553808","546163","544114"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["deer","snow","winter","survival","adaptation","ear","fur","breeze","blanket","step"]}
