{"path":"552863.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts two men working on a wooden barge or fishing vessel. The setting is likely a river or lake due to the presence of calm water in the background, under an overcast sky which diffuses the natural light subtly across the scene.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a man is actively using a shovel, engaged in scooping or manipulating what appears to be a pile of clams or oysters. He is dressed in a long-sleeve blue shirt, a light-colored bucket hat, and dark pants, and is leaning forward slightly into his task, demonstrating the effort being exerted.\n\nTo the right, another man is partially visible. He stands behind a large wheel apparatus, likely part of the vessel's machinery, used perhaps for hauling nets or regulating the barge's positioning. This individual is wearing a striped, short-sleeve shirt and a cap. He appears to be adjusting or operating the wheel.\n\nThe overall scene highlights manual labor, specifically related to the fishing or shellfish industry. The barge itself is fitted with various mechanical and metal components, suggesting a mix of traditional and slightly older industrial equipment. The focus and framing of the photograph emphasize the work being done by these individuals in their maritime environment.","title":"Lake Borgne oystermen claim release of Mississippi River flood waters has polluted their oysterbeds.
