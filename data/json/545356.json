{"path":"545356.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph shows a striking urban scene distinguished by the contrast between the architectural elements. On the left, thereâ€™s a series of connected buildings painted white, with aged and slightly deteriorated facades. Each segment features a dark painted door and a set of windows topped with red ornamental arches that add a touch of design amidst a utilitarian construction style. The buildings possess an older, maybe early 20th-century look, possibly indicating a historical or older residential area.\n\nA standout element in this scene is the construction on the left front where scaffolding-like frames are set up next to a building, suggesting ongoing construction or renovations. This is juxtaposed against a traditional wooden picket fence running alongside the walkway, enhancing the residential feel.\n\nOn the right, the image is dominated by a building painted in a vivid, solid red color that powerfully draws the viewer's eye. This building, with its bright hue and clean, sharp lines, stands in contrast to the softer, more worn appearance of the white buildings.\n\nThe setting is a narrow alley or street with stone or concrete paving, enclosed on either side by the buildings. The ground appears old and patched, indicating wear and frequent use. Overhead, a thin glimpse of a serene sky can be seen, hinting at calm weather.\n\nIn the back, beyond the buildings, limited sections of the sky and a few indistinguishable structures are visible, suggesting a densely populated urban area. Overall, the photograph captures a vibrant tableau reflecting both the decay and renewal common in urban architectural environments.","title":"Fifth and mesa in the second ward.
