{"path":"552146.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive view of a large number of white birds, possibly gulls, scattered over a wet beach at low tide. The birds are spread across the scene, many of them in flight, creating a dynamic and lively atmosphere. The shore alternates between bands of water and sand, reflecting the light and emphasizing the patterned texture of the tidal flats. The colors visible are mostly dark browns and blues with the whiteness of the birds providing a stark contrast. The background is relatively indistinct, putting the focus on the patterns formed by the alternating strips of water and the mass of birds. The overall mood is one of natural abundance and the environmental interaction of wildlife with their habitat.","title":"Snow geese fly over Stillaguamish River estuary on Puget Sound near Stanwood.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552238","553347","549738","547008","543282","557123","544504","557125","554600","549772","549757","557121","544609","557126","545991","543281"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","flat","abundance","mass","tide","band","flight","strip","habitat","wildlife"]}
