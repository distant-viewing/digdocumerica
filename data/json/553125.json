{"path":"553125.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a large, sparse residential area that appears to be in a semi-arid or desert region. The settlement is laid out in a grid pattern, with straight streets and roads carving through the landscape, intersecting at right angles. The houses are mostly one-story, quite spread out, with varying amounts of space between them. They appear to be predominantly white or light-colored, likely reflecting modern, possibly prefabricated construction.\n\nThe photo shows that the development is on relatively flat terrain, surrounded by natural vegetation which tends to be scrubby and sparse, indicative of a dry climate. There are no large trees visible, just short bushes and scattered patches of grasses or ground cover.\n\nOn the edges of the developed area, the grid pattern of the streets gives way to more irregular paths that weave through the natural landscape, suggesting these might be earlier or less formal developments. The outer roads mark a clear boundary between the constructed environment and the wild, natural surroundings.\n\nFrom this altitude, no people or moving vehicles are visible, suggesting a focus on the layout and the relationship between the built environment and the natural world around it. The overall feel is of a quiet, organized community integrated within a challenging geographical and climatic setting.","title":"Urban sprawl outside Reno","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["544629","546399","548825","545914","544510","553935","546765","553693","554166","553934","544564","552730","553692","544550","556975","553700"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["grid","development","relationship","street","settlement","pattern","world","amount","altitude","road"]}
