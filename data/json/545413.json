{"path":"545413.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph captures a Caucasian man seated and using a respiratory therapy device. He wears a short-sleeved, patterned dress shirt and a white neck brace, indicating he could be undergoing medical treatment or recovery. The man is holding a tube connected to a mask over his mouth, through which he appears to be inhaling or exhaling.\n\nIn the background, a large, dark green oxygen tank is visible, mounted on a metal stand and equipped with valves and pressure gauges, suggesting a clinical or medical setting. There are several tubes connected to the tank, emphasizing its use for medical purposes.\n\nOverall, the setting looks like a small, simple medical room or a corner of a clinic, indicated by the modest surroundings including pale walls, a small brown bench where the man sits, a file or storage box to the left, and visible electrical outlets and switches, all of which contribute to the clinical feel of the environment. The lighting inside the room is subdued, focusing attention on the man and his interaction with the medical device.","title":"Damaged lung patient receiving treatment","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545416","553035","545420","545486","545482","545395","545409","545412","545552","556568","556567","545399","545481","556575","553029","545480"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["tube","device","room","outlet","tank","switch","valve","pressure","recovery","gauge"]}
