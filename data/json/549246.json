{"path":"549246.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a natural landscape dominated by several tall pine trees. The view is upwards towards a clear, bright blue sky with a few dispersed white clouds. The sun is partially visible through the branches of one of the pine trees, casting a radiant glow and creating a silhouette effect against the trees.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows the earthy ground covered by patches of grass and a few scattered wildflowers, suggesting this is a meadow or a lightly forested hill. The growth of the trees and the angle of the sunlight suggest that this photo could have been taken in the late afternoon. The composition of the photograph beautifully frames the sun peeking through the trees, emphasizing the contrast between the dark outlines of the pine trees and the bright sky behind them. The setting is serene and there are no visible human activities or man-made structures, providing a sense of tranquility and isolation in nature.","title":"This land, which lies next to the Westmoreland Coal Company strip mine, is next on the agenda for expanding operations.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["554955","555119","550537","542927","554461","556990","554588","550604","542849","546162","557020","543016","557159","554393","554394","553575"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["pine","tree","sun","meadow","disperse","peek","wildflower","growth","outline","glow"]}
