{"path":"552229.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a serene landscape during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset. The scene is dominated by a large body of water reflecting the sky, interspersed with several islands of varying sizes. Surrounding the water are rolling hills and landforms covered with dark, dense vegetation.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, with clouds hovering near the horizon, casting shadows over some areas of the land and water. A soft, golden hue from the sun highlights the clouds and parts of the water's surface, creating a warm, glowing effect across the composition.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a tranquil and somewhat mysterious atmosphere, enhanced by the dim lighting and the expansive view of nature. The color palette is mostly subdued, with deep blues and purples blending into the grays and golds of the sky and reflections on the water.","title":"Lake Washington at sunset.
