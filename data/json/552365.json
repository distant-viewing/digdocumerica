{"path":"552365.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a dynamic scene on an airfield, partially framed by a large aircraft, the edge of which is visible in the foreground. The bold focus of the image is a yellow helicopter with black and white stripes on the tail, captured mid-flight as it nears landing or take-off. The helicopter's side features a number, 301, and it is seen from a side view, showcasing its spinning rotors and streamlined shape.\n\nIn the foreground, the edge of another aircraft adds a layer of depth to the composition. This edge features several hoses or tubes, which protrude diagonally towards the top of the frame. These are likely part of the aircraft's refueling or mechanical systems.\n\nThe background behind the helicopter is relatively nondescript, indicating a typical airfield setting with flat pavement and sparse, low vegetation under an overcast sky. There are no people or other distinct activities visible; the focus is solely on the aviation elements. The perspective and composition suggest a an observer's viewpoint, possibly from within or beside the aircraft in the foreground, giving the scene a sense of immediacy and involvement in the aviation activity.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["545642","545638","544737","545637","552372","544741","544771","548815","547533","555835","552393","544491","552373","552370","542577","544754"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["aircraft","helicopter","aviation","near","off","rotor","immediacy","edge","observer","tube"]}
