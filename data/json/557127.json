{"path":"557127.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a sprawling landscape view filled with dense foliage of various shades of green, orange, and brown, suggesting an autumnal setting. The scenery is composed predominantly of vast expanses of trees, with the canopy showing a mix of seasonal colors. This broad view suggests a high vantage point, possibly taken from a hilltop or similar elevated area.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by dense shrubs and trees in varying stages of autumnal color transition, with some leaves still green and others having turned to richer, deeper hues. No definite paths or clearings are visible amidst the foliage, providing a sense of unbroken natural growth.\n\nFurther into the middle ground, the tree density reduces slightly, allowing for glimpses of the terrain's undulating nature. Here, hues become slightly muted, creating a soft gradient effect that gives depth to the landscape.\n\nIn the background, the landscape flattens out into what appears to be a distant plain or valley floor, with a somewhat obscured view due to either fog or overcast sky. The sky, visible at the upper part of the photograph, is cloudy, casting an overall muted light across the scene and enhancing the subdued color palette typical of a cloudy autumn day.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a serene, almost introspective ambiance, typical of natural landscapes during the transition into the colder months, with no human activity or man-made structures visible, emphasizing its untouched and serene natural beauty.","title":"Fall scene near the Missouri River near White Cloud and Troy, Kansas, in the extreme northeast corner of the state. The area is unique because it contains the only hardwood forest in the state in addition to tallgrass prairie. Along the river are found loess Bluffs, a glacial-formed solid earth Bluff, characteristic of the area.","placename":"White Cloud (Kan.)","location":"White Cloud, Kansas","nn1":["554715","554637","546090","558074","550602","557165","557159","554718","550603","557821","554756","554713","558012","550478","554653","554728"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["transition","hilltop","month","flatten","reduce","become","foliage","hue","fog","undulate"]}
