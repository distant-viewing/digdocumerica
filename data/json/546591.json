{"path":"546591.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image captures a busy multilane highway at night, dense with traffic. The perspective is elevated, looking down the length of the highway as it stretches into the distance. The road is slick with what appears to be recent rain, which reflects the lights of the vehicles and street lamps, adding a glossy sheen to the scene.\n\nNumerous cars, visible by their headlamps and tail lights, are congested across several lanes, indicative of either peak traffic time or a possible slowdown. Each lane is bordered by the glowing, arching lights of the street lamps that cast a continuous light across the roadway.\n\nIn the background, atop a hill, a classical building with prominent columns illuminated softly stands out against the dusk sky. This structure offers a striking contrast to the modernity and bustle of the traffic below. The building looks similar to a neoclassical style often seen in significant public or historical buildings.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is one of movement and a busy urban lifescape, juxtaposed with elements of classical architecture that suggest a setting near a city of historical importance.","title":"Evening traffic-jam from Washington, dc to Virginia on memorial bridge.
