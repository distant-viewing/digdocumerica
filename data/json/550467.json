{"path":"550467.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph depicts a vast, flat landscape that stretches out to the horizon, which is visible across the entire width of the image. The ground is covered with dense, low-growing vegetation showing a mix of green and dull brown colors. In the foreground, slightly off to the right, there is a small brown prairie dog standing upright. The creature appears vigilant or alert and is positioned on a small mound within the grassy terrain, making it a focal point amidst the uniformity of the surroundings. The sky above is clear and spans across the top of the frame, emphasizing the expansiveness and isolation of the scene. The natural light suggests it could be either late afternoon or early evening.","title":"A parka squirrel in the tundra","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552903","557189","550489","549186","549183","548673","556990","549156","550397","546129","545579","549238","548703","545341","544019","544581"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["prairie","expansiveness","uniformity","creature","width","dog","mound","evening","isolation","mix"]}
