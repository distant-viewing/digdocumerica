{"path":"553709.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene that appears to be set in a market or outdoor gathering, possibly during an event or festival. Central to the image are two women, dressed traditionally and wearing straw hats, amidst an informal, vibrant setting.\n\nThe woman on the right, whose face is partially visible, adjusts what appears to be a classic, slightly sun-worn straw hat with her right hand. She wears a navy blue dress adorned with white details, contributing to her traditional and practical attire suitable for outdoor activity.\n\nThe woman on the left, seen from behind, is in the process of putting on or adjusting a large, intricately woven straw hat that covers her head completely. Her dress has a floral pattern with pinkish tones on a light background, creating a striking contrast with her hat. Her posture suggests movement and interaction with the other woman, highlighting a moment of connection or conversation.\n\nThe background is softly focused but bursts with color and life. Visible details suggest the presence of flowers, perhaps part of a market or decorative element of a gathering. Other people appear farther in the distance, diffused by the depth of field, contributing to the lively atmosphere of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph, with its vivid colors, traditional clothing, and active posture of the subjects, evokes a sense of cultural richness and communal activity, typical of a festive or market scene.","title":"Dressed for aloha day parade during annual aloha week festivities","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["557040","553275","547437","549924","558295","553915","553759","553251","553242","551699","553178","543864","551436","553916","554051","553761"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["straw","market","hat","woman","adjust","gathering","posture","put","richness","burst"]}
