{"path":"555631.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph features a large industrial machine, possibly a mining or excavation device, viewed from its upper end looking down towards its base. The machine is metallic and has a tall tower-like structure with intricate details such as ladders, platforms, and an operational cabin at the top. It appears to be situated on a barren terrain, filled with scattered rocks and debris, indicating recent or ongoing excavation work. \n\nDirectly underneath the machine, there is visible machinery, likely part of the operational structure, involving conveyor belts or tracks. At the base of the machine, there are two large, colorful trucks with white cabs, red bodies, and gray dump areas parked facing the machine, presumably to collect or deliver materials.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate scene of industrial activity, a contrasting serene landscape unfolds. A well-maintained, winding road meanders through green, mildly hilly terrain. The road is bordered by lush trees and fields, and it features a few overpasses or flyovers. The weather appears hazy, possibly due to dust or mist, which softly blurs the distant hills and foliage. The overall composition juxtaposes the harsh, mechanical foreground against the peaceful, natural backdrop, highlighting an intersection of industrial endeavor and natural scenery.","title":"Coal company power shovel at work strip mining land near interstate 70 and Morristown, Ohio","placename":"Morristown (Belmont County, Ohio)","location":"Morristown, Ohio","nn1":["555644","554826","555633","553827","552416","556505","555586","554765","544099","543639","547243","552418","544134","554828","554764","545831"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["machine","excavation","deliver","base","cab","ladder","overpass","unfold","conveyor","endeavor"]}
