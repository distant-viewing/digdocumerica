{"path":"547115.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image captures a coastal erosion control scene where several construction or maintenance activities are underway to address environmental degradation. In the foreground, a large pile of sand dominates the scene, with visible tire tracks indicating recent movement of heavy machinery. To the right, a dump truck is actively tipping more sand onto the pile, suggesting ongoing work to fortify the area against shoreline erosion.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo reveals a sloped, barren earth leading down to the beach, where several cylindrical objects (possibly concrete sewer pipes or erosion control structures) lie partially buried in the sand along the water's edge. These structures may serve a functional role in protecting the shoreline or could be debris.\n\nIn the background, the calm sea stretches across the horizon, intersecting mildly with the sandy beach. Adjacent to the beach are buildings and trees, somewhat blurred and undetailed, indicating a residential area close to the shore. The overall environment and activity suggest a concerted effort to combat coastal erosion, possibly following a storm or as a preventive measure in an erosion-prone area.\n\nThe sky is overcast, lending a somber mood to the scene, and the lack of visible people suggests that the primary focus of this image is on the environmental and infrastructural elements at play.","title":"House in background is threatened by beach erosion.
