{"path":"553714.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of an individual dressed as a clown. The clown is wearing an elaborate costume which includes a wide, ruffled white collar trimmed with red and a blue garment underneath. The most striking part of the attire is a white helmet with a vivid decal on the side; the decal depicts a cartoon clown's face with a red nose and black and red hair. The same style and colors are echoed on the clown's face makeup, which includes a white face with red accents around the lips, cheeks, and the nose, as well as dark, exaggerated eyebrows. Additionally, the clown is wearing classic aviator sunglasses, which add a contrasting modern touch to the traditional clown makeup and outfit.\n\nThe clown's helmet also features other signs and texts, including one that says \"Aloha Temple.\" The background of the photograph is blurred with hints of deep blue and red tones, focusing attention on the detailed features and expressions of the clown's face and attire. The intricate details specific to the clown's makeup and costume, along with the protective helmet and sunglasses, suggest this might be during an outdoor activity or event, possibly a parade or a public performance where safety is a consideration.","title":"Costumed for Aloha Day parade, one of many festivities during annual Aloha Week","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["549582","549569","549575","553282","549578","553200","553710","546659","553712","553240","546028","553309","554043","548571","551919","545454"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["decal","costume","helmet","nose","face","sunglass","cartoon","cheek","consideration","lip"]}
