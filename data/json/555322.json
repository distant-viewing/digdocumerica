{"path":"555322.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph showcases a close aerial or satellite view of ocean waves creating patterns of foam. The image captures the textured surface of the sea, depicting multiple parallel rows of waves, each frothed with white foam glistening under sunlight. The dark hues of the ocean water provide a stark contrast to the bright white of the foam, enhancing the visual texture of the sea's surface. The photograph is taken from such an angle and proximity that the entire frame is filled with the rhythmic undulations and sparkle of the water, giving it both a sense of motion and tranquility. There are no discernible landmarks, people, or objects other than the natural marine patterns, resulting in a pure and focused portrayal of the ocean's dynamic beauty.","title":"An experimental solar heating panel being tested at New Mexico state university, Las Cruces.
