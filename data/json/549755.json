{"path":"549755.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and intimate moment between a couple taking a leisurely walk in a park during what appears to be autumn or early winter. The setting is an open grassy area interspersed with several leafless trees, indicating the colder season.\n\nIn the foreground, on the left, there's a picnic table adjacent to a wire trash bin which has a label that might be an abbreviation or a park code. The grass is sparse, covered with scattered leaves, emphasizing the season.\n\nThe couple, located in the middle of the image, are the focal points. Both are dressed in cool weather attire. The woman wears a plaid coat in red and black, while the man is in a bulky gray jacket and jeans, suggesting a casual outdoor activity. They are holding hands and engaged in conversation, looking at each other, which adds a sense of connection and warmth to the scene.\n\nIn the background, beyond the couple, the area opens up further with more trees and a line of tall, dense reeds, possibly surrounding a lake or wetland area. Slightly discernible in far background are some residential structures, hinting that this park is near a suburban area.\n\nOverall, the composition uses natural lines and spacing brought about by the arrangement of the trees and walking path, leading the viewer's eye towards the couple, emphasizing their interaction and the peaceful, expansive setting of their walk.","title":"Former landfill in bergen county has been converted into a park","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["549756","557940","548267","549922","550051","553065","551942","557939","551682","546075","550234","551945","554901","547180","548467","551462"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["couple","walk","season","code","park","bin","picnic","reed","bring","warmth"]}
