{"path":"545100.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene twilight scene featuring a river foreground, a lighted industrial facility in the middle distance, and a wooded hillside in the background. The time appears to be either dawn or dusk, as suggested by the gradient of orange and blue hues in the sky, which blends into the darker upper portion indicating nighttime.\n\nThe river meanders through the scene, reflecting the lights from the industrial complex and other sources placed sporadically along the riverbanks. The water is calm with visible sandbanks emerging from it, adding texture to the reflective surface. \n\nThe industrial facility dominating the middle-ground is brightly lit, contrasting starkly with the surrounding dim environment. Visible smoke or steam is rising from multiple points within the facility, dispersing into the air and adding a layer of atmospheric haziness.\n\nThe far background is formed by a silhouette of a forested hill, which gently slopes across the horizon and creates a natural boundary for the sky. The image evokes a sense of quiet activity, where nature and industrial life coexist at the meeting of day and night.","title":"Coos bay at night","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["550819","542995","550820","545430","547807","545646","552164","551140","557234","546118","557239","543004","547102","552188","552597","557376"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["facility","sandbank","nighttime","meeting","disperse","coexist","emerge","river","night","meander"]}
