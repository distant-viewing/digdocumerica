{"path":"550605.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a vibrant river scene. The main focus is the river, which flows from the top right corner diagonally toward the bottom left of the frame. It is filled with white, frothy water indicating rapid movement. The river's banks are covered with a multitude of smooth, rounded rocks and stones, varying from small pebbles to larger boulders. \n\nThe riverbank on the left side gently slopes up to a background of inclined terrain, sparsely covered with low vegetation. The right bank appears more densely vegetated with bushes and small trees, adding greenery to the scene and contributing to a natural, rugged landscape. There are no visible human activities, structures, or people in this image; the scene captures a pure and untamed river environment, likely in a mountainous or remote area. The lighting suggests itâ€™s either morning or late afternoon, casting soft light and creating a serene ambiance.","title":"Gulkana river.
