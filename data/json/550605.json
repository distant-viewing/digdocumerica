{"path":"550605.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a vibrant river scene. The main focus is the river, which flows from the top right corner diagonally toward the bottom left of the frame. It is filled with white, frothy water indicating rapid movement. The river's banks are covered with a multitude of smooth, rounded rocks and stones, varying from small pebbles to larger boulders. \n\nThe riverbank on the left side gently slopes up to a background of inclined terrain, sparsely covered with low vegetation. The right bank appears more densely vegetated with bushes and small trees, adding greenery to the scene and contributing to a natural, rugged landscape. There are no visible human activities, structures, or people in this image; the scene captures a pure and untamed river environment, likely in a mountainous or remote area. The lighting suggests itâ€™s either morning or late afternoon, casting soft light and creating a serene ambiance.","title":"Gulkana River. Salmon swim more than 200 miles up the Copper River from Prince William Sound to reach the headwaters of the Gulkana River in order to spawn. The pipeline crosses the Gulkana farther south at mile 643. Fast and clean, the Gulkana is typical of Alaska's many salmon-spawning rivers and streams.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550658","542743","555674","549550","544856","553420","549442","553653","542523","550698","548156","546171","553855","552061","550367","542557"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["river","bank","multitude","pebble","boulder","riverbank","corner","bush","bottom","stone"]}
