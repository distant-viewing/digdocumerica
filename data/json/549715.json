{"path":"549715.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man standing in the foreground, appearing as a central figure with a striking presence. He is dressed in a unique and colorful outfit that includes a plaid coat, dark trousers, and a white cap labeled \"Captain Bob-Lo.\" He also holds a pair of binoculars in one hand and a red-tipped cane in the other. His facial expression is serious and somewhat stern.\n\nIn the background, several young people can be observed. A group, possibly teenagers, stands in a hallway or corridor that seems to be a part of a larger building or ferry, as indicated by the life preservers visible on the wall and the maritime-themed attire of the man. The young people are dressed in casual attire typical of the era, likely the 1970s or 1980s, suggested by their fashion style: jeans, t-shirts, and casual tops. They appear to be in a relaxed, social setting, chatting and waiting, with expressions ranging from neutral to smiles.\n\nThe composition of the photograph emphasizes the contrast between the elderly man's distinctive, formal, themed attire and the casual, youthful style of the background group, highlighting a blend of generations and roles within a shared space. This intriguing setup suggests a story or an event, possibly related to a boat or ferry cruise, where \"Captain Bob-Lo\" might be a significant or celebrated figure.","title":"90-year-old Captain Bob-Lo greets passengers.
