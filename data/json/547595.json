{"path":"547595.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment beside a vast body of water, likely a sea or large lake. The scene is framed with two bicycles leaning against a low, concrete wall in the foreground. These bicycles appear to be road bikes with curved handles, positioned lying on the ground which suggests a casual stop by their owners.\n\nCentered in the image, on top of the wall, are two people sitting close to each other, engaged in deep conversation. They are silhouetted against the bright, expansive backdrop of the water, highlighting their interaction. The person on the left appears to be wearing a dark jacket, pants, and has a squat, forward-leaning posture. The person on the right looks to be wearing a light-colored jacket and darker trousers, sitting with a slightly upright posture facing the individual on the left.\n\nThe background is a vast, calm sea stretching to the horizon under an overcast sky, which adds a mood of tranquility and introspection to the scene. The composition uses a simple, uncluttered approach that emphasizes the vastness of the environment around the two figures, making their interaction appear intimate yet open and airy. The overall ambiance is peaceful, reflecting a moment of personal connection in a natural setting.","title":"Conversation on the sea wall","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["549471","554494","550245","548833","543950","553396","543885","547241","543461","551967","543601","543951","543203","547217","554901","551945"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["bicycle","posture","owner","sea","introspection","jacket","approach","handle","bike","stop"]}
