{"path":"551504.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street scene that appears to take place in an urban setting. In the foreground, an elderly man is riding a bicycle toward the camera. He is wearing a cowboy hat and a patterned shirt, giving him a distinctive look. To his left, there are three women who appear to be in conversation as they wait to cross the street. They are dressed in light, floral or pastel clothing, typical of casual, possibly summer, attire.\n\nThe background is filled with two buses, indicating a busy city environment. The buses have a vintage style, reflective of older models, which are parked or stopped beside a tree-lined street. Further back, there's a glimpse of more pedestrians and city architecture, including a partial view of a sign that reads \"Pabst.\"\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, with shadows casting over the street, and the overall ambiance is that of a bustling, sunny day in the city. The composition of the photograph, with its candid capture of everyday urban life and a mix of transportation methods, illustrates a vibrant city rhythm.","title":"Transportation modes on Nicollet Mall--bus, bicycle, and foot","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551445","548388","556791","556749","548369","551478","551471","556708","557272","547814","548368","556199","549906","556742","546668","549662"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["city","street","bus","rhythm","method","stop","bicycle","ride","wait","pedestrian"]}
