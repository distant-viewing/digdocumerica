{"path":"546086.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene of a white goose standing in a body of water, likely a pond or small lake. The goose, appearing alert and stately, is positioned towards the right-hand side of the frame. It is looking to the left, with its body mirrored perfectly in the calm water, providing a sharp reflection. The water surface is tranquil, suggesting little to no wind, and there are ripples around the goose hinting at recent movement.\n\nThe surrounding environment features natural elements primarily consisting of water and vegetation. On the right side of the photo, you can see the edge of the water bank, which is lined with tall, dense reeds and grasses, indicating a wild or rural setting. These plants are reflected in the water, slightly blurred, enhancing the overall calmness and quiet beauty of the setting.\n\nThe lighting in the image implies it might be early morning or late afternoon, as the soft light provides a warm tone and enhances the textures of the goose's feathers and the surrounding foliage. The composition of the photo, focusing on the goose with ample space around it, emphasizes the solitude and tranquility of the scene, inviting the viewer to reflect on the simplicity and peace of natural settings.","title":"Duck in city park lagoon","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["557122","553346","557120","558091","557568","557126","550388","555551","553408","557121","543918","545991","558092","547630","556987","543063"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["water","feather","peace","reed","calmness","pond","simplicity","mirror","invite","photo"]}
