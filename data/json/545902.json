{"path":"545902.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene where a deer stands prominently in a lush, wild meadow. The deer, positioned on the right side of the frame, is depicted in profile with its head turned slightly towards the left, giving it a gentle, alert appearance. Its body is lightly illuminated by what appears to be soft, natural light, highlighting its smooth coat and the subtle details of its facial features and ears.\n\nThe background and surroundings are densely populated with various types of vegetation, exhibiting rich, dark green and yellow tones. There are several distinct plants in the foreground, including clumps of grass and possibly wildflowers, which add texture to the scene. The overall mood conveyed by the lighting is calm and somewhat muted, suggesting the time of capture could be either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the deer off-center and ample space around it, invites the viewer to explore not only the animal but also its natural environment, emphasizing a sense of tranquility and unspoiled wilderness.","title":"Mule deer","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["544916","546163","554621","545898","552339","558368","543279","543369","544571","553808","542955","544114","544623","542778","542963","546159"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","ear","clumps","off","alert","meadow","wildflowers","explore","ample","profile"]}
