{"path":"545412.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly Caucasian man lying in a clinical or medical setting, looking directly at the camera with a solemn, somewhat weary expression. He has white hair and visible wrinkles on his face, emphasizing his age. The man is wearing a nasal cannula, a device used to deliver supplemental oxygen or increased airflow to a patient in need of respiratory help. This plastic tube is fitted around his ears and under his nose.\n\nHe is dressed in a hospital gown, suggesting he may be a patient receiving medical care. The background is blurred and predominantly blueish, highlighting the man as the central subject. The image captures a somber mood, reflecting the possibly critical health condition of the man. The focus is sharp on his face, with details such as his furrowed eyebrows and deep-set eyes being notably expressive. The overall tone and setting give the photograph a clinical and intense atmosphere.","title":"Damaged lung patient receiving treatment","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545409","545408","545420","545407","545552","553035","545416","545413","545486","545482","545399","556567","552871","543906","556452","556575"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["patient","gown","hospital","deliver","increase","wrinkle","man","receive","nose","ear"]}
