{"path":"549314.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This image captures a lively outdoor scene where several people are gathered in what appears to be a park setting. The photograph shows a group of individuals actively engaged by two rows of viewfinders on what might be a scenic overlook or an open public area. Each individual is interacting with a mounted binocular-style viewfinder, which is typically used for observing distant objects. The people are diverse in terms of fashion and style, suggesting a casual, yet vibrant social atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a metal railing, which closely contains the scene, indicating that this area is designed for visitors to pause and take in the views. One can see details such as a trash can with a sign reading \"DEPOSIT LITTER IN BASKETS,\" underlining the public and maintained nature of the setting. \n\nThe attire of the individuals is notably varied; some wear patterned shirts, others sport solid colors, and hairstyles range from afros to more trimmed looks, reflecting a mix of personal expressions typical of a public, urban environment. Trees can be glimpsed in the background, suggesting that the location is either within a park or adjacent to some green spaces. \n\nOverall, the scene is dynamic and colorful, filled with individuals who are each engaged in the act of looking through viewfinders, possibly exploring or appreciating the scenic beauty of their surroundings.","title":"People enjoying Memorial Day holiday at Battery Park in Lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551808","551811","543238","550076","551809","555947","553311","551814","550302","550074","557179","558295","551798","558294","551812","557985"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["individual","public","afro","binocular","appreciate","basket","deposit","hairstyle","pause","explore"]}
