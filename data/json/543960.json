{"path":"543960.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph depicts a vivid scene at a dock featuring both a historical reenactment group and a riverboat. The riverboat, labeled \"DELTA QUEEN,\" is a large, traditional multi-level paddle steamer with three visible decks. Each deck is crowded with passengers, who range from children to adults, casually enjoying the view or the event occurring alongside the boat. The boat is adorned with decorative elements in red, white, and blue, and multiple American flags are displayed prominently.\n\nIn the foreground of the photo, a group of men dressed in colonial-era military uniforms is performing. This ensemble includes individuals in red coats with white accents, black tricorn hats, white breeches, and black shoes with buckles. Several of them are playing drums decorated with a blue and yellow motif featuring a symbol that appears to be an eagle. Other uniformed men are playing flutes. The group is lined up in a formation suggesting they are part of a ceremonial performance or a reenactment.\n\nThe background shows a hint of a dock area with some wooden structures that might be part of the mooring facilities for the boat. This setting gives the photograph an historical atmosphere, connecting the modern-day use of the riverboat for leisure with the historical context provided by the uniformed reenactors. The overall image captures a lively and colorful event, blending historical and recreational themes.","title":"Fife and drum corps perform on Louisville waterfront, where paddlewheel steamboat is docked.","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543954","543964","543966","543972","545732","545917","545736","550029","554657","554658","553835","543971","545921","543967","548507","547838"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["riverboat","reenactment","deck","boat","group","dock","ensemble","mooring","event","paddle"]}
