{"path":"546835.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a moment where a young person is actively using binoculars. The individual, with light brown hair which partially covers their face, is viewed from a side profile. They are lifting the binoculars with both hands, focused on viewing something at a distance. \n\nThe person is dressed in what appears to be a denim jacket, suggesting the setting might be outdoors during cooler weather. Behind them, a pale gray-blue background, likely a body of water, provides a calm and minimalistic backdrop. A portion of a rope is also visible to the right in the frame, hinting that the individual might be on a boat or near a maritime setting.\n\nThe focus of the image is sharply on the person and the binoculars, emphasizing a sense of curiosity or discovery. The composition and framing are tight on the subjectâ€™s upper body and hands, drawing attention to the action and the tool being used. The overall atmosphere can be described as serene yet engaging, capturing a moment of exploration or observation.","title":"One of the students on a school tour of the Baltimore harbor.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["553592","547124","557179","547849","553221","547864","547116","547070","547125","547089","546312","552290","543744","543740","549384","543238"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["binocular","person","discovery","describe","maritime","hand","curiosity","observation","framing","lift"]}
