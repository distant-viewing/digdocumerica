{"path":"550141.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph shows an urban scene with mixed signs of dilapidation and everyday urban life. On the left side of the image, there's a visibly aged and worn wooden house with peeling paint and boarded windows, suggesting neglect or abandonment. The house casts a shadow onto a neighboring structure, creating a contrast in textures and colors.\n\nIn the middle ground, the focal point is a well-lit billboard advertising cigarettes, which features an image of a man and a woman. The slogan \"How good it is!\" is prominently displayed. This billboard stands out with its bright and vibrant colors against the more muted shades of the surrounding environment.\n\nTo the right of the billboard, a part of a building can be seen with a small window displaying signs for Coca-Cola and other sundries, implying a small store or commercial establishment.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several street-level items that add to the setting: a traditional blue USPS mailbox sits at the curb, and directly behind it a 'One Way' traffic sign is installed, indicating the direction of traffic flow on the adjoining street.\n\nTwo individuals are near the corner of the building on the right, engaged in conversation or perhaps a transaction, adding a human element to the scene. Their presence suggests regular life continues in this area despite the apparent economic challenges indicated by the building's conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition paints a picture of urban life that juxtaposes commerce and decay, activity and neglect, creating a thought-provoking visual narrative.","title":"\"How good it is\" sLogan in ironic conjunction with decaying inner city buildings","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["549785","555897","550285","550108","550127","550203","546051","545353","552751","545388","555902","550143","550132","557345","553557","553472"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Billboards"],"terms":["billboard","neglect","neighboring","transaction","mailbox","traffic","slogan","sign","life","house"]}
