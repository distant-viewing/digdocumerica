{"path":"545880.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The image captures a rural scene focused on a picturesque flowering roadside. In the foreground, the roadside is lush with a vibrant mix of wildflowers showing blossoms in various shades of red, pink, orange, and white, intermingled with greenery which suggests the peak of spring or summer bloom.\n\nThe middle of the image features an asphalt road that curves slightly to the left. Traveling on the road is an old-fashioned light-colored pickup truck going away from the viewpoint at a moderate speed, blurring slightly due to motion which adds a sense of liveliness to the serene environment.\n\nIn the background, beyond the road, there is a large leafy tree isolated near the road, offering a bit of shade. Behind that, the landscape continues, offering hints of a tranquil rural area with partially visible distant trees and a faintly seen clear blue sky that may suggest a sunny day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph juxtaposes the natural beauty of the wildflowers against the human-made elements of the road and the vehicle, emphasizing a peaceful coexistence of nature and human mobility in rural settings. The photograph might evoke feelings of travel, nostalgia, or the beauty of unspoiled natural landscapes.","title":"Wild flowers","placename":"Austin (Tex.)","location":"Austin, Texas","nn1":["548971","542642","554832","554130","556405","547300","552549","554031","557549","556429","542709","554562","556960","545367","547354","545723"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["road","roadside","wildflower","liveliness","mobility","blossom","nostalgia","asphalt","pickup","bloom"]}
