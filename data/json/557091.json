{"path":"557091.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil, rural landscape at either dawn or dusk, characterized by muted and soft natural light. The foreground features the dark silhouettes of densely packed trees, which gradually open to reveal a serene river running horizontally through the middle of the composition. The river reflects the light from the sky, creating a shimmering effect on the water.\n\nBeyond the river, the middle ground extends into flat farmland with scattered areas of standing water or wetlands, possibly due to recent rainfall or irrigation. On the left side of the photograph, in the middle distance, there is a farm with a couple of storage silos and a barn, typical of rural agricultural settings.\n\nThe background is layered with more trees and open fields, fading into the horizon under a hazy sky. This layering effect creates a sense of depth, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape. The overall atmosphere of the image is calm and serene, typical of rural scenes away from urban bustle.","title":"Early morning view of the Missouri River from the abbey of Benedictine College at Atchison, Kansas.
