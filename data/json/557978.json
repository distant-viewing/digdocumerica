{"path":"557978.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural setting with a field and utility poles. The foreground showcases a field densely populated with mature crops, possibly corn, showing signs of browning and drying, suggesting it's late in the growing season. Interspersed throughout are flecks of white, which might be flowers or another type of plant.\n\nA series of utility poles, which appear relatively new and in good condition, line up across the field, extending into the distance. These poles are equipped with multiple crossbeams and wires, some of which sag slightly between the poles.\n\nThe background is marked by a line of lush, green trees which form a dense forested area, creating a natural boundary for the field. Above, the sky is mostly clear with a few fluffy, white clouds, indicating a sunny day with good weather.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the tranquility and expanse of rural farmland, punctuated by the organized vertical lines of the utility poles, adding a human-made element to the natural landscape.","title":"The cuyahoga valley land used for farming is mostly planted in corn, although utility poles can be seen in some of the fields.  This land is part of the cuyahoga valley national recreation area.  It contains some 30,000 acres of undeveloped land between the metropolitan areas of Cleveland and Akron, Ohio.  This picture was taken from ira road looking, south, near Akron.  The valley is rich in indian history and included commerce on the Ohio-erie canal until superseded by the railroads","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557977","548296","555609","543823","549222","553696","544678","545971","547404","555541","552541","552521","544726","544481","547300","547316"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["pole","utility","field","fleck","corn","farmland","line","punctuate","grow","dry"]}
