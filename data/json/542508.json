{"path":"542508.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene with multiple elements that suggest agricultural activity, likely associated with aerial application. In the foreground, there are numerous bags piled atop one another, prominently featuring the brand \"BEST CHEMICALS\" along with a slogan reading \"You Get Results With BEST CHEMICALS.\" The bags appear to be made from sturdy material, possibly paper, and are slightly crumpled and weathered, indicating they've been actively used or are in a setting that involves exposure to outdoor elements.\n\nIn the background, there is a biplane, centered and positioned in the middle of an airstrip. The aircraft has a single propeller and a fixed tail-dragger landing gear, suggesting it might be used for crop-dusting or spraying chemicals, which correlates with the presence of chemical bags. The plane is parked on a dirt runway, which furthers the impression of a rural or semi-developed location typically used for agricultural aviation.\n\nThe general photography style indicates an early morning or late afternoon setting, given the golden hue and shadows cast, which soften and enrich the colors within the scene. This light provides a somewhat dramatic and vivid portrayal of an everyday agricultural operation. The setting is open and expansive, suggesting a rural environment conducive to such activities.","title":"California - near Fresno","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["542503","542504","553873","542578","549072","553044","542495","542506","542499","542505","542496","548903","542502","547297","549036","542498"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["chemical","bag","dusting","biplane","application","propeller","runway","aviation","slogan","landing"]}
