{"path":"557328.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man standing next to a large solar panel apparatus. The solar panel unit is mounted on a low, wide base that appears to be made of wood, and is titled at an angle towards the sky, optimized for catching sunlight. The structure is quite large compared to the man standing beside it, highlighting its scale. The man is dressed in a dark suit with a tie, suggesting a formal or professional occasion, and he is smiling slightly as he poses with one hand resting on the structure.\n\nIn the background, the facade of a building can be seen, displaying a sign that reads \"SOLARON\" in large, block, red letters. The building itself has a simple, mid-century modern design with a flat roof and minimalistic architectural details, colored in light beige or white. The ground is paved, and the overall setting suggests an industrial or commercial area. The sky above is partly cloudy with ample light, indicating it might be midday or early afternoon.\n\nThis setting and attire suggest that the man may be involved in a professional capacity with the solar energy project, possibly during a promotional event or a demonstration of the technology captured in the photograph.","title":"John Bayliss, president of the Solaron Corporation, the first publicly owned solar energy company in the nation","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["555323","555293","557312","555347","555349","557332","555341","555309","555327","555348","557320","557334","555343","555331","557319","555288"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["panel","capacity","demonstration","man","occasion","beige","apparatus","project","midday","technology"]}
