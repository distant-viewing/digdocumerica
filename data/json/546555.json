{"path":"546555.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil outdoor setting where a young woman is engaged in reading or studying alone in a grassy park. The setting is full of natural light and scattered with numerous small flowers and dandelions, indicating a spring or summer season.\n\nThe woman is seated on the grass, leaning slightly forward with her long hair falling over her shoulders, partially obscuring her face. She is wearing a long-sleeve shirt or jacket that appears casual, and jeans, with blue fabric shoes. Adjacent to her is a single large tree trunk that vertically bisects the image, adding a natural element to the composition and providing a sense of shade where she sits. The tree casts a shadow over her, suggesting bright sunlight in the environment.\n\nA noticeable element in the frame is a book or binder open in front of her, resting directly on the grass, indicating that she might be engaged in studying or leisure reading. The peacefulness of the environment and her focused demeanor suggest a serene moment of solitude and concentration. The background is softly focused, highlighting the expanse of the lush, green park around her and enhancing the calm and secluded atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Columbus East Senior High School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546566","543835","553156","551970","546474","549911","551682","550067","554223","554424","552033","546478","552723","544747","554099","553222"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["reading","study","dandelion","bisect","peacefulness","grass","fabric","woman","book","outdoor"]}
