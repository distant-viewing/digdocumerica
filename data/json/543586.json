{"path":"543586.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This image features a picturesque natural landscape dominated by a vibrant and diverse range of flora. In the foreground, a wide expanse of a marshy meadow is blanketed with lush, green vegetation and clusters of broad-leafed plants. The meadow seamlessly transitions into a dense forest comprising mostly coniferous trees, hinting at a robust, undisturbed ecosystem.\n\nIn the background, majestic snow-capped mountains ascend into the sky, their rugged peaks partially covered in white snow, contrasting with the dark green of the forest below. This suggests a high-altitude environment possibly in a colder climate or early in the season when the last remnants of winter snow still cling to the higher elevations.\n\nThe overall composition paints a serene and untouched natural scene, possibly within a protected national park or a remote wilderness area, offering a sense of tranquility and the enduring beauty of the natural world.","title":"Meadow","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["543569","543582","555660","555682","554459","552143","554461","549225","550536","555657","544936","557003","549139","550629","550439","550441"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["meadow","snow","cling","ascend","endure","forest","world","elevation","protect","flora"]}
