{"path":"549066.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a river setting with a landscape that includes a distant mountain range and a clear sky. Captured from an elevated perspective, the focus of the image is on a motorboat traversing the river. The boat is colored red and white and propels forward, creating a spray of water, with visible waves fanning out behind it. The water of the river appears dark and reflective, capturing the light and surrounding landscapes. On the left side of the riverbank, there are dense trees, possibly indicating a natural or less urbanized area. The mountains in the distance under the clear sky add a serene and expansive backdrop to the scene, suggesting a setting that could be ideal for recreational boating and nature exploration.\n","title":"Boat on the Colorado River","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549458","555693","552330","548934","547685","548926","544749","551208","550989","545043","546976","548077","548921","549532","551217","545654"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","motorboat","boating","mountain","spray","riverbank","exploration","range","wave","perspective"]}
