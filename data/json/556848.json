{"path":"556848.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image captures a scene within a train car, showing various passengers during their journey. The focus is on two passengers in the foreground who appear to be asleep. The man on the left, younger and wearing large round glasses, leans against the window with a pillow behind his head, wrapped in a thick olive-green cardigan. Beside him, an older woman, donning a significant amount of jewelry including earrings and a necklace, is also asleep with her head resting against a pillow on the back of the seat. She is seen wearing a grey cardigan over a greenish blouse.\n\nIn the background, other passengers are visible, all appearing engaged in quiet activities such as sleeping, reading, or contemplation. The setting is a passenger train with seats upholstered in a patterned fabric of reddish and blue tones, and it provides a somber yet comfortable commuting atmosphere. The light available in the scene is soft, reflecting a calm, possibly early morning or late afternoon travel time. The window next to the young man shows a blurred natural landscape, indicating the moving train and providing an added sensation of travel.","title":"Passengers dozing and passing the time on Amtrak's Broadway Limited enroute from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. The train began the previous afternoon in Chicago and stopped in Harrisburg where it was split into two sections. One headed for the nation's capital and the other went to New York City. Persons who slept late had to do without breakfast until they arrived because the dining car which was supposed to continue with the train did not.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556097","556062","556842","556839","555974","556834","555977","556081","556656","549893","555998","556117","554370","556835","556095","556833"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["passenger","pillow","cardigan","train","travel","upholster","head","jewelry","commuting","earring"]}
