{"path":"552744.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a smiling young man wearing a black beret and large, clear-framed glasses. He appears joyful and is dressed casually in a cream-colored, zip-up jacket over a white shirt. His pose is relaxed, with one hand slightly adjusting his jacket. The backdrop is a textured wall, deeply etched with graffiti that includes various names and scribbles, contributing to a gritty, urban atmosphere. The numerous inscriptions, while not entirely legible, add a layer of depth and abstract beauty to the composition, reflecting a dense, street art aesthetic. The lighting on the subjectâ€™s face highlights his features and adds to the overall cheerful and engaging mood of the image.","title":"Member of a street gang in north Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["556148","557034","556142","556622","557056","552873","556147","556443","552752","553168","547338","548224","551300","556149","556415","548725"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["scribble","etch","smiling","inscription","abstract","jacket","graffito","cream","art","gritty"]}
