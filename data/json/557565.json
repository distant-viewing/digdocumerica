{"path":"557565.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene early morning scene on a body of water, likely a river or a lake, enveloped in a light mist or fog that suggests the coolness of dawn. Two individuals are seated in a small, simple rowboat, silhouetted against the softer light reflecting off the water. One person appears to be engaged in fishing, holding a fishing rod, while the other person sits facing them, likely conversing or observing. The background features a dimly lit hill or mountain with thick foliage, and the sun filters through the leaves, creating a dappled light effect.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the image is peaceful and calm, emphasizing a connection to nature and a moment of tranquility. The uses of natural light and shadow, along with the mist on the water, add a mystical, almost ethereal quality to this early morning fishing scene. The framing and the silhouette technique highlight the outline of the figures and their activity, emphasizing their interaction and the simplicity of the moment.","title":"Youngsters doing a little early morning fishing on Malibu Lake in the Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County. The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles County. This area so far has escaped intensive development pressure. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increasing land use pressure.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552313","552308","557563","552317","543753","549933","547549","546980","546976","552123","550000","551350","547555","552314","552124","547230"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["fishing","mist","rowboat","technique","morning","fog","person","rod","framing","connection"]}
