{"path":"546225.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a man inside a store, engaged in a conversation on a telephone. The interior setting suggests it is a store specializing in automotive products, indicated by the various items neatly organized on shelves around the room. These items include motor oils, car care products, and different types of lubricants, displayed in labeled cans and bottles, suggesting a methodical organization.\n\nThe man, who appears cheerful, is wearing a gray work shirt with a visible name tag. The lighting in the store is natural, brightening the space and contributing to the inviting atmosphere.\n\nBehind him, a metal display rack holds additional items for sale, and a work chair is seen in the background, indicating a space for personal or customer seating.\n\nThe composition also shows a partial double exposure or reflection effect on the right side of the image, where parts of the shelving unit and products subtly overlap with the view of the man, adding a dynamic visual element to the scene. The photograph has a generally warm tone, encapsulating a moment of daily life in a workplace environment. The vibrant but coherent color scheme throughout contributes to a lively and functional atmosphere typical of a specialty retail store.","title":"Leakey drug store","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["554870","557688","546101","557763","546628","557835","546226","557852","556207","557902","549723","549870","557864","557918","551832","554869"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["store","product","item","shelving","specialize","brighten","overlap","telephone","rack","motor"]}
