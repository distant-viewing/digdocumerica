{"path":"552525.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a dense array of submerged vegetation floating on the surface of a body of water. The water appears gentle and largely calm, reflecting the pale color of the sky above, possibly indicating an overcast day. The vegetation is thick and green, with leaves and stems interspersed across the entire frame, suggesting a richly vegetated aquatic environment. There are no visible human figures or animals in the scene, which directs the focus entirely toward the natural elements. The reflection of unseen trees or structures can be faintly observed on the waterâ€™s surface, creating a textured and layered effect. The overall mood is serene and somewhat monochromatic due to the predominant blending of greens and blues.","title":"Stagnant water surrounding the Pearl steam and electric generating plant","placename":"East Saint Louis (Ill.)","location":"East Saint Louis, Illinois","nn1":["543561","544524","554623","545115","557445","551352","547509","550750","550834","543558","547532","557254","557442","547639","549641","544525"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["blending","animal","surface","vegetation","array","water","reflection","leave","effect","green"]}
