{"path":"551666.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street scene characterized by urban commercial life and art appreciation. The central focus is a young woman standing in front of a display of variously sized and styled framed art pieces. These artwork pieces are laid out on the sidewalk leaning against supports, likely set up for sale or viewing. The woman, dressed in a light blue sleeveless dress and sandals, smiles subtly towards the right side of the frame, her blonde hair draping over her shoulders.\n\nBehind the art display, there is an intricate urban background featuring large signage with the logo \"abc\" in a bold, modern design, indicative of a commercial or corporate building. This is flanked by a building with a glass facade reflecting the bustling street activity and framed by dark structural elements.\n\nThe scene also includes several pedestrians and bystanders. To the right, a diverse group of individuals, including both young and elderly men and women, are sitting and chatting near the art display, contributing to the casual and inclusive atmosphere.\n\nThe overall composition uses natural lighting that highlights the vivid colors of the artworks and the lively interaction among people against the more neutral tones of the building facades. The setting suggests a dynamic urban environment where art, commerce, and everyday interactions converge.","title":"Print seller outside the american broadcasting company building in midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553242","551693","551694","553177","553254","558194","553266","551823","551695","551493","551686","551829","549916","556215","554179","549671"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["art","artwork","woman","facade","display","sandal","piece","viewing","chat","appreciation"]}
