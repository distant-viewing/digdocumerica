{"path":"544842.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene featuring a single white egret walking across what appears to be a dry, sparse landscape. The egret is featured prominently in the right portion of the image, shown in profile as it walks gracefully with one leg lifted mid-step, suggesting motion. Its long neck is slightly curved, leading to its pointed beak, which is directed forward, while its eyes are focused ahead.\n\nThe background and foreground of the image are quite barren, consisting of dry soil and scattered patches of short grass or vegetation. The soil is mostly in shades of brown and grey, with the sparse vegetation adding slight touches of green. There's no water or other animals visible in the immediate surroundings, which emphasizes the solitude and calmness of the setting.\n\nLighting in the photograph lends an overcast or soft quality, with diffused light illuminating the egret and the ground, enhancing the details of the bird's feathers and the rough texture of the ground. The overall mood is one of quietness and natural simplicity, focusing primarily on the movement and grace of the egret in its natural habitat.","title":"Farmington bay waterfowl management area on east shore of Great Salt Lake.
