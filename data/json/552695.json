{"path":"552695.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a misty mountainous landscape. Several mountain peaks of varying altitudes are visible, enveloped partially by low-hanging clouds and fog, lending a mystical and serene aura to the scene. The coloring is predominantly muted with shades of gray and subtle hints of earth tones, suggesting either an overcast day or an early morning or late evening time. The foreground is less detailed, allowing the mountains in the midground to become the focal point of the composition. The varying density of clouds around and between the peaks creates a textured look to the atmosphere. There are no visible structures, people, or animals, emphasizing the natural and untamed character of the landscape. The image conveys a sense of isolation and profound tranquility.","title":"Clouds over Rifle","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["544070","546764","542848","553825","554962","555110","543831","543023","554634","554398","555132","555130","550628","542923","555378","542676"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["peak","aura","coloring","mute","become","mountain","vary","cloud","altitude","density"]}
