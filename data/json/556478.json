{"path":"556478.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph displays a close-up side view of an older African American man with a calm expression. He is wearing a dark-colored hat with a structured, flat brim. The man's skin is textured and shows signs of aging. His facial features are highlighted by natural lighting, emphasizing deep-set eyes and wrinkles. Additionally, he has a graying mustache and beard.\n\nA key feature in the image is a pipe held in his mouth, partially supported by his mustache and lips. The pipe appears to be made of dark material with a noticeable patina, suggesting it has been well-used.\n\nThe background of the image is blurry and indistinct, allowing the viewer to focus entirely on the man's facial features and the details of the hat and pipe. The color palette is fairly natural, dominated by the skin tones and the dark shades of his attire and the pipe. The photograph captures a moment that hints at thoughtfulness or contemplation.","title":"Edward Austin, 64, lives in the black portion of fireco, a small town near Beckley, West Virginia, in Raleigh county.
