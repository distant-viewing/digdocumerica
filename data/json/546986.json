{"path":"546986.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene agrarian scene likely in a rural setting. The most prominent features are the agricultural activities involving a farmer and a horse. The person, appearing to be a male, is dressed traditionally for farm work, with a long-sleeve shirt, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat for sun protection. This individual is actively engaged in plowing a field, using a horse-drawn plow. The horse, well-equipped with a harness and plow attachment, is an integral part of this farm labor scene, standing amidst rows of young crops.\n\nThe setting is a lush, open field filled with rows of young, green crops which could be corn or some similar plant given their height and leaf structure. The soil is rich and dark, indicating fertile ground, suitable for agriculture. In the background, a dense cluster of trees and presumably shrubs line the horizon, presenting a natural boundary for the field and adding a layer of privacy and seclusion to this rural landscape.\n\nThe sky above is clear and vividly blue, suggesting a bright, sunny day, which enhances the vibrancy of the greenery and the overall pastoral beauty of the scene. The image exudes a sense of peaceful coexistence between man, animal, and nature, highlighting a traditional farming practice that relies heavily on manual labor and animal help. This portrays a picturesque example of rural farm life, possibly captured to document traditional agricultural methods or just to capture the sheer beauty of the traditional interaction between humans and nature in a farming context.","title":"A farmer cultivates his corn field on St. Helena's Island.","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["546996","546957","557696","544888","547304","552562","552577","554203","553665","554204","547297","547436","543667","544319","549036","544323"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["horse","farm","farming","crop","labor","field","animal","help","attachment","corn"]}
