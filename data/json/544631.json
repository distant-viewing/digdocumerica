{"path":"544631.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The image captures a great egret in mid-flight, directly above a thick bush of dark green foliage with a clear, bright blue sky as the background. The egret is portrayed in a dynamic flight pose with its long wings fully extended, displaying the delicate feathers and wing structure vividly against the sky. Its legs trail behind, adding to the sense of motion. The texture and detail of its plumage are highlighted, particularly the fluffy feathers on its body and the sleek, longer feathers at the edges of its wings. The birdâ€™s neck is stretched forward, and it looks straight ahead, emphasizing its streamlined body shape adapted for flight. The light source, likely the sun, illuminates the bird from the side, creating a soft glow on its body and wings, enhancing the ethereal quality of the scene. The vegetation below appears as a dark, dense mass, providing a natural contrast to the lightness of the sky and the egret's elegant form. This composition captures the grace of avian motion and the tranquility of a serene natural environment.","title":"One of the egrets who inhabit the chokoloskee rookery in Everglades National Park","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["547745","544616","548732","547593","544842","543922","544482","544516","544478","545967","545142","551379","544486","557204","544489","547322"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["egret","feather","wing","flight","bird","grace","motion","plumage","bush","adapt"]}
