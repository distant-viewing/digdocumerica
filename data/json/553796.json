{"path":"553796.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of a group of people boarding a bus at a bus station. The view is taken from an elevated perspective, looking down at the people and the bus.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a group of men ascending the stairs of the bus. The men appear to be of various ages, predominantly wearing casual or work attire such as buttoned shirts and slacks. Some are carrying items like newspapers. The bus has a prominent white and black striped design on its exterior, making it quite distinctive.\n\nTo the left of the bus, we can see a queue of people waiting to board. This group is diverse in terms of age and dress, implying that they are likely from different walks of life.\n\nIn the background, there is a parking lot filled with cars from an older era, suggesting that the photo may have been taken in the mid to late 20th century. Beyond the parking lot, some buildings and structures are visible but not prominently detailed.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of an ordinary day-to-day activity, characterized by the mundane task of people boarding a bus, possibly either starting or ending their workday. The elevated angle provides a comprehensive view of the bus station area, capturing a slice of life from a past era.","title":"\"sea transit\" ferry has been operating for one year between downtown Honolulu and pearl harbor - an alternative to freeway congestion.
