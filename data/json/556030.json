{"path":"556030.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image is an aerial photograph of a dense urban area, capturing a mix of architectural styles and periods. The composition prominently features a variety of buildings, including what appears to be both residential and commercial structures.\n\nForeground: A prominent building in a modernist style dominates the front part. It is characterized by its long, horizontal lines and a flat roof; perhaps a hotel or an office building with a large, circular driveway — indicative of mid-20th-century architecture. Adjacent to this is a multi-lane road that curves around it, supporting vehicular traffic that is visible in the image.\n\nMidground: The center of the photograph shows a cluster of older, taller buildings likely dating from the early to mid-20th century. These structures include a high-rise building with a pyramidal top and a large clock near its peak, suggesting it may be a municipal or an iconic commercial building.\n\nBackground: Dominated by smaller, evenly spaced buildings that mostly appear to be part of residential or light commercial areas. The straight streets indicate a planned urban layout.\n\nGeneral Atmosphere and Details: The area is tightly packed with buildings showing little open space, characteristic of many downtown urban cores. Colors in the image are varied, suggesting different building materials and ages—whites, beiges, and darker brick colors. The density and variety of the buildings suggest a dynamic city environment.\n\nOverall, the scene is a bustling, dense urban sprawl viewed from an aerial perspective, capturing a snapshot of city life and architectural diversity. No people are discernibly visible, likely due to the altitude at which the photograph was taken. The photograph also includes elements of transportation infrastructure, including a series of railways or major roads that cut across the scene, further emphasizing the urban and developed nature of the area. The image also shows the blend and transition of architectural styles from perhaps a more historic core to newer developments surrounding it.","title":"An aerial view of the lone star as it makes its way through downtown Oklahoma city enroute from Chicago to Houston, Texas amtrak is working to reverse the downward trend of rail passenger travel between the end of world war ii and the beginning of the 1970's.
