{"path":"551157.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene featuring a group of cattle cooling off in a small pond. The image is set against a picturesque landscape that includes expansive fields stretching back to distant forested hills under a clear blue sky. The cattle, appearing in various shades of black, white, and brown, are grouped mainly in the water, which reflects parts of the sky and surrounding greenery. The foreground shows some lush green vegetation, possibly shrubs or small plants, framing the pond. The fields beyond the pond are fenced, and more cattle can be seen grazing peacefully in the background. The natural setting and the composition of this photograph suggest a calm, pastoral environment, likely on a warm day given the cattleâ€™s choice to wade in the water.","title":"Peaceful scene on Route 35 near Pt.
