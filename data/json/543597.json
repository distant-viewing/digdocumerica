{"path":"543597.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures two delicate pink flowers prominently in the foreground. Each flower has five pale pink petals with a slightly darker pink hue near the petal tips and a distinct central region that appears to be brownish-orange. The texture of the petals seems soft and slightly translucent, suggesting a thin and delicate structure.\n\nThe flowers are surrounded by greenery, possibly consisting of thin, fine leaves or grass blades that partially overlap and frame the flowers. The background is blurred with shades of green and dark tones, creating a bokeh effect that brings attention to the sharp detail of the flowers in the foreground.\n\nThe lighting in the image is soft and natural, suggesting that it might have been taken outdoors during daylight. The overall composition focuses intimately on the natural elements, emphasizing the subtle beauty of the flowers set against the soft, indistinct background.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["554843","554595","557618","554574","553588","557167","553366","543623","554576","542970","545726","554115","547642","544875","555035","550462"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","petal","blade","tip","daylight","leave","effect","region","attention","hue"]}
