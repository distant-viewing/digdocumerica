{"path":"548773.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene where a large crane is in operation. The crane is mounted on a red and black tracked vehicle, which is stationed on a rough, unpaved surface, likely a construction site or similar industrial setting. The crane is tall, with a long metal lattice boom extending upward and slightly to the left of the frame. Suspended from the crane's boom is a heavy lifting accessory with metallic appearance, resembling a large hook or lifting basket, which dangles mid-air.\n\nIn the background, a natural landscape is visible, featuring vibrant green bushes and trees interspersed with rough, hilly, white terrain that may be piles of sand, rock, or other construction materials. Beyond this immediate setting, a body of water (possibly a river or a lake) in a light blue hue covers the horizon, enhancing the scene's contrast with the industrial equipment in the foreground. The sky appears mostly clear with a hint of blue.\n\nOverall, the photograph presents a juxtaposition of heavy industrial machinery against a natural waterside environment, capturing a moment of operation within a broader ecological context.","title":"Land development near boca chica key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["545655","554545","545648","548559","544157","548775","548772","555593","549308","547615","544268","557729","545887","547216","547181","544109"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["crane","lifte","waterside","lifting","hook","lattice","accessory","construction","boom","basket"]}
