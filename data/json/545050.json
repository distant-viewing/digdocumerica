{"path":"545050.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a landscape scene dominated by an expansive view of nature artificially bisected by human infrastructure. In the foreground, two thick, dark utility poles frame the left side, while a large, metallic electrical transmission tower stands prominently on the right. The power lines from the tower stretch across and out of the frame, drawing the viewer's eye along their path.\n\nIn the middle ground, the natural environment takes over with lush, bushy green foliage and grasses subtly tinged with wildflowers. These provide a soft contrast to the man-made structures.\n\nThe background is dominated by a striking, snow-capped mountain, which looms in the distance beneath a pale, serene sky. The mountain's snowy peaks are highlighted, standing out against the lighter sky and darker foreground, drawing attention as a serene yet powerful presence in the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition skillfully juxtaposes the elements of man-made achievements and natural beauty, suggesting themes of coexistence or intrusion, depending on the viewer's interpretation. The scene also subtly plays with the depth of field, from the detailed close-up of the poles and power lines to the grand, sweeping vista that is the mountain.","title":"Power lines","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548135","549110","544355","557977","543728","546054","548136","549011","543130","553028","552349","557525","544690","553830","542643","542524"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["mountain","power","depend","achievement","interpretation","draw","pole","tower","transmission","intrusion"]}
