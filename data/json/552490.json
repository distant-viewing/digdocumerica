{"path":"552490.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The image depicts an old building's side entrance and window in an urban setting. On the left side of the photograph is an entrance, above which hangs a worn-out sign that reads \"SCOTT'S POOL HALL\". The door is painted in red but its paint is peeling off, revealing wood and previous paint layers underneath. A neighboring window is slightly open, with a visibly dirty, tattered curtain obstructing part of the view inside. The window frame is painted white but is largely decayed, with patches of wood visible beneath the peeling paint.\n\nJust adjacent to the doorway, a small street-facing window is visible. It has a red frame, which seems to contrast with the otherwise dilapidated appearance. Like the doorway, the brick wall around it is showing signs of decay and neglect, primarily through discoloration and weathering. The ground outside the entrance is somewhat overgrown with small weeds, which are sprouting through the cracks in the concrete.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the aged and neglected exterior of an apparently still-operating business, evoking a sense of past vibrancy now faded. The setting likely suggests an economically depressed or older urban area. The nighttime setting, inferred from the lighting and shadows, adds to the sense of abandonment and decay.","title":"Abandoned pool hall in Middlegrove","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552964","550129","555952","547894","552510","557347","553478","557139","550023","550140","546051","545355","554707","550285","550108","552528"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["entrance","paint","doorway","window","decay","neighboring","wood","discoloration","weed","hall"]}
