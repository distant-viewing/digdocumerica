{"path":"542938.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph portrays a somber scene of deforestation. In the foreground, a person, dressed in light-colored pants and a dark shirt, stands contemplatively on a large, freshly cut tree stump. The stance of the individual, with hands in pockets and facing away from the camera, suggests a contemplative or thoughtful demeanor, possibly reflecting on the environmental impact showcased around.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is strikingly barren on the left side, where large areas of the hill have been cleared of trees, revealing raw, exposed earth. This side contrasts sharply with the right side of the image, which displays a dense, lush forest stretching across the rolling hills. The clear division between the logged area and the untouched forest highlights the drastic alteration of the landscape.\n\nThere are numerous other tree stumps visible around the individual, indicating the extent and recent activity of the logging. Bits of branches and scattered foliage add to the chaotic and disrupted feel of the landscape. The background features hills that roll into the distance, coated in either dense forest or bare, similar to the immediate surroundings. The sky is clear, adding a quiet serenity to the stark, impactful scenario below it. This photograph captures the impactful human intervention in nature and evokes a poignant reflection on the environmental consequences of such activities.","title":"Only stumps remain after clear-cutting operations on these slopes.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545258","542864","555092","555150","555136","542820","557590","555221","542865","555208","553468","550348","555104","545138","545264","555107"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["stump","forest","hill","consequence","deforestation","extent","division","disrupt","alteration","pocket"]}
