{"path":"558009.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a natural outdoor scene, most likely in a forested wetland area. The composition captures a small, narrow water channel, partially covered with green aquatic plants, possibly duckweed or water lilies. Surrounding the water are dense thickets of trees and shrubs, exhibiting a variety of colorsâ€”greens, reds, and some early autumnal yellow and orange hues, suggesting this image was possibly taken in early fall.\n\nThe trees closest to the water are primarily deciduous with what appears to be some dead or bare branches extending upwards, possibly indicating some degree of forest degradation or natural tree life cycles. The light filtering through the canopy casts subtle shadows and highlights across the scene, enhancing the texture of the leaves and the surface of the water.\n\nThe overall feel is quiet and secluded, possibly a habitat for various wildlife species like birds, amphibians, and small mammals, providing a sense of serene, untouched wilderness. The photograph does not include any human structures or activities, offering a purely naturalistic view of this wetland environment.","title":"Marshy area topped with algae north of deep lock quarry, a part of the Akron, Ohio, metropolitan park system.  It was the route of the Ohio-erie canal which was built between 1825 and 1827 and flourished until 1913 when a flood and the railroads put the waterway out of business.
