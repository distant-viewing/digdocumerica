{"path":"552336.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft, dim lighting and muted colors. The image prominently features a large body of water, perhaps a lake or a wide river, surrounded by multiple layers of hills or low mountains that recede into the hazy distance. The silhouette of a forested landmass, possibly an island, can be clearly seen in the foreground section of the water.\n\nThe foreground of the picture is framed by the silhouettes of tall coniferous trees, likely pines or firs, which are common in mountainous or northern regions. These trees frame the view and add depth to the composition, contrasting with the relatively smooth texture of the water and the soft, undulating outlines of the hills.\n\nThe coloring of the scene is dominated by shades of blue and grey, interspersed with subtle hints of purple and gold, suggesting the low light of early morning or late evening. There is a gentle mist or fog hanging over the water and the distant hills, enhancing the sense of depth and adding a mystical or tranquil quality to the landscape.\n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a quiet and contemplative mood, inviting viewers to pause and absorb the natural beauty of this serene and timeless landscape.","title":"Sunset over northern Puget Sound and the San Juan Island","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["557000","542994","549446","552142","543590","557561","554752","557519","557570","557572","552229","554616","543625","554753","553569","550389"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["hill","fir","silhouette","coloring","landmass","gold","pine","fog","island","water"]}
