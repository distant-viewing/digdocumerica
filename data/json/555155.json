{"path":"555155.jpg","date":"July 1970","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features an abstract composition of numerous rectangular and square shapes, which appear to be compacted packs of elongated crystalline forms, possibly resembling shards of glass or ice. The arrangement shows iridescence, depicting a diverse array of blues and whites that shimmer as though reflecting light. The shapes are densely packed in some areas while more scattered in others, creating a pattern that feels both chaotic and structured.\n\nThe background is uniformly dark, enhancing the contrast with the luminescent quality of the shapes in the foreground. This deep, shadowy backdrop emphasizes the bright, reflective nature of the shapes and highlights their intricate detail and angular edges.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of dynamic complexity, perhaps mimicking natural forms like minerals or ice crystals under magnification. The composition suggests a focus on texture, pattern, and the interplay of light and shadow, evoking a sense of both fragility and permanence.","title":"Log booms in southern Puget Sound, Washington, near Seattle.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557626","555174","544716","557609","555226","550606","555838","552239","550372","555177","550373","555804","557314","557581","550374","553258"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["shape","ice","crystal","mimic","pack","compact","shimmer","mineral","form","complexity"]}
