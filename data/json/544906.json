{"path":"544906.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor adventure scene, depicting a person hiking through a rugged, rocky terrain that appears to be a canyon or a mountainous area. The person, who appears to be a woman, is dressed in blue shorts, a blue shirt, and a wide-brimmed hat, indicating protection against sun exposure and suitable for outdoor activity. She is carefully navigating her way down a steep, smooth rock surface, using her hands for support and carrying a wooden stick that might be used as a hiking aid.\n\nThe surrounding landscape features large, curved rock formations, predominantly in shades of beige and pink, with layered striations indicative of sedimentary rock. Few patches of green vegetation, possibly small trees or shrubs, can be seen nestled in rocky crevices, adding a bit of color contrast to the otherwise monochrome rocky scenery.\n\nThe sky above is almost clear with a very light hint of clouds, suggesting a bright and sunny day which is typical for desert or canyon environments. The overall impression is one of a challenging yet scenic outdoor adventure in a remote, rugged location.","title":"White Canyon near the Sipapu Bridge, Natural Bridges National Monument","placename":"Utah","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545785","544902","545781","545759","544305","545772","545762","545697","545700","545758","544301","544903","545766","545768","544898","544928"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["canyon","adventure","rock","aid","striation","crevice","stick","protection","beige","hiking"]}
