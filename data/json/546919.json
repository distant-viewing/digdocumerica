{"path":"546919.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene featuring a large cargo ship named \"Chevron Hawaii.\" The ship, painted in hues of red and black, dominates the frame with its massive hull and complex superstructure visible towards the back. The vessel is partially loaded, indicated by the waterline marking on the hull.\n\nIn the foreground, a tugboat is seen assisting the cargo ship. The tugboat, which appears smaller in size, is in motion, generating ripples and waves in the water. The waters are relatively calm, shimmering slightly under what seems to be an overcast sky.\n\nOn the left side of the image, another aspect of the port infrastructure is just marginally visible, possibly a pier or docking area.\n\nIn the bottom part of the image, several people are seen observing the scene. They are small in scale compared to the massive ship, highlighting the enormity of maritime operations. These onlookers, appearing as silhouettes due to the lighting and distance, add a human element to the industrial scene.\n\nThe background features a coastline which is not in sharp focus, suggesting some distance from the main activity in the foreground. There are sparse structures and possibly some vegetation along the coast, under a sky that contributes to the somewhat muted color palette of the scene.","title":"Tugboats move the newly launched tanker, \"chevron Hawaii,\" to its berth","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546909","546751","546843","551990","548127","553740","546766","552244","550892","555270","547627","550896","552303","546828","548126","545845"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","tugboat","hull","cargo","enormity","waterline","superstructure","onlooker","generate","coast"]}
