{"path":"550780.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene natural setting featuring a small, red rowboat partially submerged in a body of calm water, likely a lake or river. The rowboat is nestled among dense wetland vegetation which includes tall grasses and reeds. These plants dominate the background and are also reflected on the water's surface, enhancing the sense of tranquility and seclusion in the scene.\n\nThe light appears soft, suggesting it could be either early morning or late afternoon, casting gentle hues and subtle shadows across the scene. The reflections in the water create a mirror-like effect, doubling the visual impact of the vegetation and parts of the boat. There are no visible people or animals, emphasizing a quiet and undisturbed natural landscape. The overall composition, with the boat as a central element surrounded by lush greenery, evokes a peaceful solitude, possibly inviting the viewer to contemplate a quiet moment in nature.","title":"Moen lake--one of the many connected lakes of the 11,815 square mile Wisconsin river drainage basin","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["550779","550000","557255","547510","547017","550975","550324","551680","550835","550769","551313","557972","557562","552310","553411","549417"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["rowboat","double","reflecte","contemplate","boat","seclusion","reed","wetland","mirror","nestle"]}
