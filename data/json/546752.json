{"path":"546752.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial site by a body of water. At the center of the image stands a large, towering structure composed of several interconnected parts. The main feature is a tall, vertical tower-like silo painted in red and topped with what appears to be a hopper or funnel. Attached to this silo, there are additional cylindrical containers and structures, also in shades of red and orange, suggesting a cohesive style for the facility.\n\nA long conveyer belt inclines towards the top of the main silo, indicating the transportation of materials either to or from the silo. This set-up suggests that the facility could be involved in processing or storing bulk materials, possibly grains or minerals.\n\nIn the foreground, the relatively calm water reflects the prominent features of the industrial facility, adding a visual symmetry to the composition. The water acts as a contrasting natural element to the stark industrial setting.\n\nIn the background, softly out of focus, one can see a clear sky and what might be other parts of the industrial complex or additional infrastructure, but these are not detailed.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image conveys a typical industrial working environment, likely dedicated to heavy material handling and storage. The photograph uses natural light, casting stark shadows and enhancing the metallic and industrial textures of the structures.","title":"Union Rock and Material Plant.
