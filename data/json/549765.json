{"path":"549765.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This image depicts a scene on a rugged, open land that appears to be a landfill site. The foreground prominently features a white sanitation truck with a round, compacted refuse body. The truck exhibits signs of dirt and wear typical in industrial vehicles used in such environments. There is a clear label saying \"sanitation\" on the side of the vehicle. A similar sanitation truck is visible immediately behind the first, and a line of additional sanitation trucks stretches back into the middle ground of the photograph. These trucks are driving on a dirt road that cuts through the landfill, evidenced by litter and debris scattered across the ground in this desolate landscape.\n\nIn the background, there is a sharp contrast to the gritty foreground: a row of high-rise buildings, possibly residential apartments, which provide an almost surreal backdrop given the stark difference between the urban development and the industrial activity in the foreground.\n\nThe sky is partly cloudy, suggesting it might be a cool or windy day. The composition of the photograph is dynamic, with the trucks curving slightly in their path, leading the viewer's eye through the scene from the foreground to the background. This visual path emphasizes the juxtaposition between urban development and the essential, yet often unglamorous, task of waste management.","title":"Trucks haul waste material to landfill area adjacent to \"Co-op City,\" a large apartment development in the Bronx.
