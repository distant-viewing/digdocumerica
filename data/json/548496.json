{"path":"548496.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph appears to capture a busy outdoor parking lot scene during a bright day. The parking lot is filled with a variety of cars, suggesting the time period might be around the 1970s to 1980s based on the vehicle designs. Notably, there is a diverse mix of car colors and styles, including sedans and station wagons.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is construction activity taking place. A large yellow bulldozer is visible, working amidst piles of dirt and debris, indicating ongoing development or perhaps an expansion of the parking area. Nearby, there are a couple of barricades hinting at restricted access to certain parts of the site.\n\nThe background showcases a large, long brick building which might be industrial or commercial based on its plain, sturdy design. Beyond this building, a scenic view opens up to a wide expanse that looks like a water body, possibly a river or a lake, accompanied by a distant shoreline that is sparsely populated with buildings and greenery.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its focus on both the parking lot in the foreground and the serene landscape in the background, paints a picture of a place that blends busy human activity with natural beauty.","title":"Airlines food services building construction seen from upper level of wood island station.
