{"path":"545161.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a fish, showing significant portions of decay and deterioration. The fish's skin has a patchy texture with visible scales and a few remaining spots of silver, gray, and black coloring. Most strikingly, the head and face area of the fish exhibit extensive damage. The flesh appears partially eaten or decomposed, with white and beige patches of possibly fungal or bacterial growth, as well as exposed underlying tissue that has a pinkish, raw appearance.\n\nThe fish's eye, though still in its socket, looks cloudy and lifeless, indicating it is no longer alive. There are two whisker-like structures protruding from its face, commonly found on varieties of fish that use these barbels to sense their environment or search for food on the ocean floor. These features are relatively intact compared to the condition of the rest of the head.\n\nThe background of the image is dark, focusing all attention on the fish itself. The overall composition underscores the stark reality of decay in marine life, possibly aiming to highlight issues of environmental impact or the natural cycle of life and death in aquatic ecosystems.","title":"Steelhead salmon was injured by \"gill netting\" operation","placename":"Corvallis (Or.)","location":"Corvallis, Oregon","nn1":["550878","546779","546185","547704","545169","552067","545063","546784","546846","543189","547737","543901","546782","546898","555560","546138"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","patchy","decompose","decay","head","pinkish","search","deterioration","cycle","coloring"]}
