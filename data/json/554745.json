{"path":"554745.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a plant in a natural setting. The main focal point is a branch of the plant bearing several fuzzy, sphere-shaped flowers clustered together. These flowers are white and have a soft, fluffy appearance, resembling dandelions in their seed stage. Surrounding the flowers are green leaves, some of which appear slightly wilted or in the process of decay, indicating that the photo may have been taken in late summer or autumn.\n\nThe plant's stems are thin and brown, curling slightly as they support the weight of the flowers. In the background, we can see a slightly blurred natural environment, possibly a forest floor. There are other green leaves and possibly small plants covering the ground, creating a dense underbrush.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a detailed and intimate look at a specific plant, highlighting its unique flowers while also presenting the environment in which it grows, suggesting a theme of natural beauty and decay. The lighting suggests it was taken on a bright day, with shadows adding contrast to the textures of the leaves and flowers.","title":"Aster in the Adirondack Forest Preserve near the top of Phelps Mountain at 3,800 feet in New York State","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545291","547642","544875","557167","554587","553368","545695","553366","554576","549230","554574","553361","545726","553074","555106","555053"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","plant","leave","decay","sphere","dandelion","seed","underbrush","weight","curl"]}
