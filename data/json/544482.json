{"path":"544482.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene featuring a cattle egret standing in a shallow body of water. The egret has a prominent bright white plumage, distinguished by its slightly ruffled appearance and the contrasting orange-buff feathers on its chest and head. It is alert and erect, casting a focused gaze across the water.\n\nThe environment around the bird includes tall, slender grasses and reeds that vary in color from greens to browns, gently swaying or standing still in the calm setting. The background is somewhat soft and out of focus, highlighting shades of brown and green, which suggests a wild, marshy habitat typical for birds like egrets. The water reflects these natural tones and the light that filters through the scene, enhancing the feeling of a quiet, isolated wetland.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its natural light, focus on the egret, and the blending of earthy tones, creates a peaceful snapshot of everyday life in a wetland ecosystem. The image captures the essence of tranquility and the simple beauty of a moment in nature where the bird is perhaps looking for food or simply resting.","title":"Cattle egret with breeding plumage near Jetport","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544478","544516","544486","545967","544842","548732","548729","544616","550388","547630","548731","547745","544631","544539","544484","544543"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["egret","bird","wetland","blending","brown","plumage","cattle","feather","chest","reed"]}
