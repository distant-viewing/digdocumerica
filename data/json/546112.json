{"path":"546112.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph shows an industrial scene with several layers of infrastructure and the natural environment. At the foreground, we see a rail bridge that features a series of metal beams and trusses, which support the rail track. There are multiple railway cars parked on the tracks at the front of the image, which seem to be cargo or freight cars, indicative of an industrious atmosphere.\n\nIn the middle ground of the image, there's a body of water presumably a river, reflecting various structures around it. On the river, there is a small, dark island with sparse vegetation. Mid-distance across the river, you can observe a partially damaged or deteriorated concrete bridge that traverses the water. This bridge is missing sections, which likely makes it non-functional.\n\nThe background shows a vast flat area that appears to be sandy and barren, leading up to a line of trees and some built structures, possibly part of an industrial plant or a distant town. The sky is faint but seems clear.\n\nThe scene overall, captured from an elevated perspective, likely emphasizes issues of industrial impact, possibly illustrating environmental degradation or industrial sprawl in a riverside area. The overall tone of the image is slightly somber due to the muted colors and signs of decay or disuse.","title":"The contaminated calcasieu river near the olin-mathieson plant","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["545988","550966","550189","547586","547890","552247","550210","556852","543709","551570","548375","552064","552253","546139","550214","546076"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","rail","damaged","river","track","traverse","deteriorate","truss","freight","disuse"]}
