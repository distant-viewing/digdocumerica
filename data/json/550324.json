{"path":"550324.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene, possibly in the early morning or late afternoon judging by the soft light and gentle hues. The main focus is a calm body of water that stretches across the frame, reflecting the sky and surrounded by various land forms. In the middle of the water, there's a small boat with at least one person, rowing gently, adding a sense of peaceful activity to the scene.\n\nThe background features multiple layers of landscape elements. There are several land masses, possibly islands, visible in the mid to far distance. The largest land mass to the right houses a small, simple white lighthouse or similar structure, lending a quaint, navigational landmark to the scenery. \n\nThe foreground is softly out of focus, with the silhouettes of branches and leaves framing the upper part of the scene and creating a natural window through which the lake is viewed, enhancing the depth and wild nature of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition evokes a quiet, tranquil atmosphere, typical of a remote natural setting, perfect for contemplation and simple, leisurely activities like rowing. The photograph uses depth and natural framing to draw the viewer into a peaceful lakeside daydream.","title":"Lobster fisherman in channel through which supertankers would have to pass if Pittstown Oil Company were granted a permit to build a refinery in Eastport.","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["557562","551207","557563","548034","550674","543531","543618","553440","543579","544266","545229","549417","552336","544031","546963","554477"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["lakeside","land","rowing","judging","masse","lighthouse","mass","landmark","island","framing"]}
