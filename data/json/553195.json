{"path":"553195.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features striking silhouettes of people against a brightly lit fountain at night. The scene captures several water streams, illuminated from below, creating a luminous and dramatic backdrop. The figures, though only visible as dark outlines, appear to be engaged in lively activities around the fountain; one figure on the left seems to be mid-jump or dance. There's a dynamic play of light and shadow, with the water's cascades highlighting the spirited motion and interaction of the people around it, augmenting the festive or celebratory atmosphere of the moment. The overall mood is vibrant and joyous, suggesting a night out or a communal gathering in an urban setting. The composition masterfully uses the interplay of light, water, and human figures to evoke a sense of movement and excitement.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553179","553196","553181","553149","550747","557268","553295","549982","557282","551647","552703","553260","551449","552539","551663","557258"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","night","figure","augment","jump","dance","excitement","cascade","strike","stream"]}
