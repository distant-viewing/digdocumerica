{"path":"551804.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts a lively urban scene viewed from a high vantage point, featuring a large, colorful turret figure of a man blowing a horn. This figure, dramatically designed with medieval or renaissance style clothing, including a vibrant blue jacket and a black hat with a feather, is seen at the forefront, contributing a unique, fantastical element to the scene. The horn and the figureâ€™s intent gaze are directed downward towards a busy street scene below.\n\nBelow, a city street bustling with activity is visible. The street is filled with people, some of which can be identified as pedestrians and others in groups, possibly tourists. Various cars and buses move or are parked along the street, indicating a busy time of day. The architecture surrounding the street is European in style, with traditional buildings that house shops and cafes, their facades featuring large windows and detailed designs.\n\nThe bustling atmosphere, combined with the historic architecture and the whimsical figure, blend a sense of everyday urban life with a touch of historic or cultural storytelling. This juxtaposition captures a vivid snapshot of the location, presumably in a European city, where history and modern life coexist and intermingle seamlessly.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people. It is totally traffic free. Not even bicycle riding is permitted. The trumpeter is one of the engaging mechanical figures on the glockenspiel in the Rathaus tower at the eastern end of the pedestrian zone.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551806","549659","549681","551789","551805","549676","551788","551790","549662","551786","549646","552705","551787","549991","551864","549680"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["horn","street","figure","turret","cafe","feather","architecture","city","tourist","gaze"]}
