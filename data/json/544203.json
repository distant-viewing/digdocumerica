{"path":"544203.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene by a wooden waterside structure, possibly a dock or small fishing pier. A child with curly brown hair is prominently featured in the foreground. The child, wearing a short-sleeved patterned shirt and striped shorts, is crouched on a set of rugged wooden stairs leading up to the pier. They are turning their head over their shoulder, away from the camera, and have a contemplative or distant expression while their hands are clasped near their chin.\n\nIn the background, another individual can be partially seen hanging up laundry on a line, suggesting domestic activities taking place within this rustic setting. The laundry items include what looks like shirts or towels, swaying gently in the breeze. The pier itself is constructed from old, weathered wood that shows signs of aging and exposure to the elements, adding a sense of resilience to the scene.\n\nThe sky in the backdrop is a clear blue, indicating a sunny day which contrasts with the shadowed areas under the pier. The environment around the pier is calm and serene, as can be inferred from the still water visible through the gaps in the wooden structure. This setting implies a close relationship with nature and possibly a lifestyle revolving around the waterfront.","title":"'Fisherman's son'","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["544207","544302","544200","552940","547727","543220","547847","544306","547001","552828","544209","548116","548523","549105","543465","543472"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["pier","laundry","chin","child","relationship","gap","towel","lifestyle","stair","breeze"]}
