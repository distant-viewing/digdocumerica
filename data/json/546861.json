{"path":"546861.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph offers a dramatic and detailed glimpse into a maritime or industrial setting. In the foreground, we see the back of a person's head, who is wearing a safety helmet. The helmet is noticeably worn and has various markings and writings on it, suggesting frequent use or a personal touch from the user. This individual is facing towards a large structure, likely a ship, which occupies the middle and background of the image.\n\nThe ship is seen from a lower angle, giving a sense of its large scale. It features various components typical of maritime vessels, like masts, antennas, and possibly communication or navigation tools. The shipâ€™s deck or some part of its superstructure is visible, along with a partially hoisted or damaged gangway or door, which adds to the industrial vibe of the scene.\n\nAdditionally, there are ropes or wires stretching across from the top left corner to the middle right, enhancing the industrial atmosphere. The sky, visible in the background, is clear and suggests daylight conditions favorable for outdoor work.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its emphasis on the person and the machinery, highlights the interaction between humans and their working environment in an industrial or maritime setting.","title":"Water filtering at the Back River sewage treatment plant","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546915","544242","546012","551046","546016","555797","546796","543894","546917","545147","552148","546918","546841","555799","549617","546850"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","helmet","superstructure","writing","antenna","communication","mast","navigation","maritime","marking"]}
