{"path":"556029.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rural landscape featuring a passenger train. The train, composed of multiple cars including white cars with a red and blue stripe, is seen traveling to the right across the image. It is led by two locomotives painted in red with white details. The train is moving alongside a road that appears almost parallel to the train tracks.\n\nThe terrain around the train is divided into various agricultural fields, showing variations in soil color from light brown to reddish tones, suggesting different types of crops or stages of cultivation. Some parts of the fields are green, indicating crops in growth, while others are bare. A narrow road cuts vertically through the picture, crossing the train tracks.\n\nTo the sides of the train tracks and across the fields, there are sporadic green trees and patches of shrubs, contributing a dash of lushness to the otherwise predominantly earth-toned scene. The overall setting implies a flat, expansive rural area.\n\nThe sky is relatively clear with soft diffusions of clouds, suggesting an early morning or late afternoon time, as indicated by the gentle lighting. The perspective of the photograph is aerial, possibly taken from a bridge or a similar elevated structure, giving a broad view of the scenery encompassing the train and its surrounding environment.","title":"The Lone Star (train #15) is shown from the air as it passes a typical rural Oklahoma crossing between Guthrie and Norman enroute from Chicago to Houston, Texas.
