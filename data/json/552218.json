{"path":"552218.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The image depicts an aerial view of a large industrial complex located near a body of water, possibly a bay or ocean inlet. The industrial complex seems to be dominated by a pulp and paper mill. There are multiple large white and gray buildings, some of which are equipped with tall smokestacks emitting white smoke or steam. Adjacent to these buildings are sprawling open areas with large piles of raw materials, such as wood chips and possibly other chemicals indicated by different colors like orange and white.\n\nThe foreground shows different storage areas with mounds of materials, some covered with white substances that could be chemicals used in the processing of pulp or paper. There are several bodies of water visible in the image - a dark blue bay on the right, a smaller lake or pond near the middle which features some industrial equipment in its center, and another small body of water in front of the mill. \n\nIn the backdrop, beyond the industrial area, a residential area with numerous houses can be seen, alongside dense patches of forest. The overall geography suggests a coastal region where industry intersects densely with natural landscapes and residential zones. The large open areas surrounding the industrial site indicate either further industrial operations or possible waste disposal areas.","title":"Crown Zellerbach kraft pulp mill at Port Townsend on the Olympic Peninsula, overlooking Puget Sound.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551578","551579","550335","555165","548128","550866","542944","552191","549510","552140","551551","550349","555769","549495","549968","551183"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["mill","bay","chemical","complex","paper","geography","chip","body","disposal","material"]}
