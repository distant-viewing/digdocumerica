{"path":"544942.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image primarily features an aged, gnarled tree set in a natural landscape. The tree is large with a wide trunk that splits into several thick, twisted branches, reaching upward and outward. The bark of the tree is rough and weathered, showing signs of aging and environmental exposure, which suggests the tree is quite old. There are green leaves and some foliage within the branches hinting at life amidst the seemingly rugged exterior.\n\nAt the base of the tree and surrounding it are smaller shrubs, some of which bear yellow flowers, adding bits of color to the scene. The ground around the tree looks dry and is possibly sandy, typical of a semi-arid or Mediterranean climate.\n\nThe sky in the backdrop is blue with some clouds scattered, suggesting it's a sunny day. The environment around the tree gives off a serene and somewhat wild natural vibe, devoid of any human activities or man-made structures in the immediate vicinity. This setting might typically be found in a nature reserve, a park, or a rural landscape where native vegetation is preserved.","title":"Hovenweep national monument","placename":"Utah","location":"Utah","nn1":["543488","551328","557623","552551","543198","557622","554099","545278","543722","543134","554977","544921","554995","550792","546157","554999"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["tree","gnarl","branch","aging","reserve","split","devoid","preserve","bark","vicinity"]}
