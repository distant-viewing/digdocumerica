{"path":"549319.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph depicts a woman engaged in an activity near a large, dark blue trash barrel. She appears to be sorting or rummaging through items, possibly placing or organizing trash into the barrel. The woman, probably in her mid-thirties to forties, is wearing a dark long-sleeve blouse paired with a skirt, and has her hair up in a practical style. She is also wearing solid dark hosiery and light-colored flats.\n\nIn her immediate surroundings, there are green park benches, and the scene occurs outdoors, evident from the presence of daylight and patches of grass visible around the pavement where she stands. The background is blurred but shows a lush green environment, suggesting this is set in a park or a similarly vegetated area. The focus is on the woman and her interaction with the barrel, highlighting her task at hand. The overall composition suggests a candid, possibly mundane daily-life scene captured in a public place.","title":"Cleaning up after lunch in battery park, in lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557284","552947","542549","551421","549839","542550","547159","557039","556498","551420","551405","554615","550162","546902","549842","550154"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["barrel","trash","vegetated","woman","organi","mundane","flat","place","occur","pavement"]}
