{"path":"553323.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a symphony orchestra performing outdoors for a large audience. The view is from behind and slightly above the orchestra, looking out toward the conductor and the audience. The conductor, positioned centrally in the image, is actively leading the musicians.\n\nThe musicians are seated under a large, green-canopied tent, which provides shade and presumably enhances acoustics. Each musician has a music stand, and many are visible playing a variety of classical instruments such as violins, cellos, brass instruments, and woodwinds.\n\nThe audience is seated in rows of foldable chairs directly facing the stage and stretches back quite far, indicating a well-attended event. Buildings surrounding the venue suggest that the concert is taking place in a city square or a similar urban public space. Some banners are partially visible, hanging from the tent, but the text on them is not clearly discernible from this perspective. Overall, the atmosphere appears festive and cultural, typical of a public orchestral performance.","title":"Eric Kunzel conducts the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra at a noon concert in Fountain Square.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553316","557264","553286","553318","551708","553297","553173","551012","551770","549702","551673","551018","557265","551670","551672","553201"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["musician","audience","conductor","tent","instrument","concert","brass","music","banner","venue"]}
