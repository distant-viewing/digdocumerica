{"path":"545817.jpg","date":"January 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of arid, desert landscape characterized by rugged mountain ranges and distinct rock formations in the background. Prominently, the foreground features the ruins of an old structure with walls made of adobe or similarly weathered bricks. The walls are partially collapsed, with some sections standing taller, showcasing openings that might have been windows or doorways.\n\nThe scenery is bathed in the soft, fading light of late afternoon or early evening, casting long shadows and imbuing the scene with a tranquil, somewhat melancholic atmosphere. The color palette is dominated by the earthy tones of the desertâ€”browns, reds, and dusty shades, contrasted with the darker, more muted colors of the distant mountains under a clear sky.\n\nThe ruins in the foreground might suggest historical or archaeological significance, indicating human habitation or usage that has long ceased. The overall composition juxtaposes the man-made remnants with the natural, enduring formations of the desert landscape, creating a poignant reminder of temporal human endeavors against the backdrop of the timeless natural world.","title":"Crumbling adobe houses in terlingua","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["544949","544951","545809","545748","544027","545826","545789","545895","544919","545761","543658","551330","543345","545565","544392","544137"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["ruin","desert","formation","reminder","poignant","collapse","endure","imbue","mountain","usage"]}
