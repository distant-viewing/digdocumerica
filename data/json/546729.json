{"path":"546729.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph is an aerial, twilight shot featuring a panoramic view of a cityscape. The image captures a large river that curves through the scene, spanned by a prominent bridge with multiple arches. \n\nThe bridge is busy with vehicular traffic, visible as lines of lights indicating movement. Along the riverbanks, dense urban development is evident, with various buildings, including notable landmarks like a large, white, domed structure on the right and a tall, slender monument in the distant center.\n\nThe photograph shows a mix of natural and urban elements, with large areas of water and tree cover juxtaposed against built-up areas. The setting sun casts a gentle pink hue over clouds in the sky, contributing to a serene yet dynamic ambiance. The lighting conditions suggest either early morning or late evening, with city lights beginning to glow as natural light fades.","title":"Potomac River and Key Bridge, looking south","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546625","545913","553846","555937","547263","546740","549490","548416","546669","543883","548317","552715","548415","548414","547429","546581"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","monument","landmark","arch","twilight","cover","riverbank","light","cityscape","evening"]}
