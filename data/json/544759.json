{"path":"544759.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene by a large body of water, with a rugged mountainous landscape in the background. The water is relatively calm with slight ripples on the surface, reflecting the varied hues of the skies above and the dark outlines of the surrounding cliffs.\n\nOn the shore, there's a pile of driftwood and small debris gathered at the edge of the water. Dominating the foreground are two people engaged in activities near a large, sturdy canoe. This canoe, dark in color, is equipped with wooden seats and bright orange flotation devices.\n\nThe person in the forefront, wearing a red jacket and a white helmet, is in a bending position as though stepping into or navigating the rocky terrain beside the canoe. The other individual, sitting in the canoe wearing light-colored outerwear and a hat, seems to be preparing or waiting.\n\nThe environment suggests a remote location, possibly a natural reserve or a park, where boating or exploration might be common activities. The clear, sunny day with no visible clouds enhances the visibility across the water and the rough texture of the landscape, adding to the adventurous vibe of the scene.","title":"Area of small mining operation","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["550659","549996","550663","552333","552982","543522","544031","544770","554661","553345","547550","558069","550822","545734","546880","558068"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","bending","reserve","driftwood","navigat","water","device","helmet","step","vibe"]}
