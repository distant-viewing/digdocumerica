{"path":"547874.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a row of vintage gasoline pumps in varying states of weathering and wear. There are four pumps visible, and they are positioned in front of what appears to be an old, possibly abandoned building with large windows and wooden frames. The primary pump in the foreground on the left is a larger, silver-colored unit with a panel prominently displaying gasoline prices and tax details. It shows a price of 34.1 cents per gallon, broken down into federal tax, state tax, and sales tax, totaling to a displayed overall sale of 4918 gallons.\n\nAbove this main pump, there is a sign protruding from the top, detailing the prices more closely. This pump also features a hose and nozzle hanging to the side, showing signs of rust and age. Adjacent to this, three more pumps are visible, closely packed next to each other, ranging in colors from faded red to turquoise and white. Each pump has a worn, rustic look, with chipped paint and visible rust.\n\nThe background shows a dilapidated structure with wooden beams and large windows that have panes missing or damaged, adding to the sense of neglect and disuse of the space. The ground is unkept, littered with debris and dried leaves, accentuating the abandoned and weathered theme of the scene. The photograph has a clear and sharp focus on the gasoline pumps in the foreground, suggesting a narrative of historical change and technological progression.","title":"Gas pumps at Sheepshead Bay Marina","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555510","554784","555495","555511","555517","555520","555405","546153","548047","548049","555502","555494","548171","555512","546973","548173"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["pump","gasoline","price","gallon","sale","rust","abandon","nozzle","turquoise","state"]}
