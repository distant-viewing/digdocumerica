{"path":"549559.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene along a seaside promenade where a large group of people have gathered to observe the dramatic ocean waves. The image shows a diverse crowd of various ages, many dressed in light jackets and casual attire suitable for a windy day at the coast. The vast, rough waves in the background suggest a possibly stormy or windy weather condition, which has attracted spectators to this scenic viewing area.\n\nThe layout of the scene includes a paved walkway where people are standing or walking. A metal railing separates the onlookers from the sea, ensuring safety while providing an unobstructed view of the water. To the left, there is a streetlamp that adds to the urban coastal environment of the setting.\n\nIn the foreground, various individuals are engaged in different activitiesâ€”some are watching the waves, others are conversing, and a few are taking photographs. The ocean, with its large, powerful waves, forms a dynamic and captivating backdrop, dominating the upper third of the image. The waves appear almost at the peak of their strength, creating a contrast with the orderly and calm demeanor of the crowd.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its mix of human interest and nature's spectacle, provides a vivid portrayal of a community coming together to experience and appreciate the power of the natural environment.","title":"Tourists on goat island enjoy a spectacular view of the canadian, or \"horseshoe falls\" from the brink of the cataract","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["543072","543389","546378","543139","553765","553773","547482","546928","546982","547155","555923","548079","552955","543492","547609","543253"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["wave","crowd","ocean","strength","spectacle","onlooker","appreciate","attract","coast","third"]}
