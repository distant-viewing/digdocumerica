{"path":"549163.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph shows a communal welcome sign located in a rural area. The sign is in the foreground, prominently displaying the message \"WELCOME COLSTRIP HELP KEEP OUR TOWN CLEAN\" with additional signage below it for \"SCHOOL FOUNTAIN HOURS\" which are listed as \"2:30 - 9:30 P.M. EXCEPT SATURDAY.\"\n\nBehind the sign, the landscape consists of open fields with sporadic clusters of shrubs or wildflowers. The terrain is relatively flat, with a few gentle hills visible in the distance. Visible on the horizon is a small community with various buildings, including what appears to be industrial or commercial structures with flat roofs. The sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting a fine day, while the natural light indicates either morning or afternoon. \n\nThe scene is tranquil, typical of a small, possibly close-knit community, emphasizing economic activities and communal gatherings, suggested by elements such as the school fountain schedule. The overall composition of the image gives the impression of a welcoming, organized small town immersed in a wide-open natural environment.","title":"The site of one of the four power plants planned for the Colstrip area","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549161","549162","553669","556461","543637","549129","544882","556420","544594","557379","545023","553831","552090","543641","552819","544845"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["school","fountain","town","help","schedule","sign","community","wildflower","message","hour"]}
