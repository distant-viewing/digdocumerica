{"path":"548724.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a man emerging from the water onto a boat. He is wearing a red life vest and has a large, circular, black snorkeling mask atop his head, complete with a snorkel tube attached. The man is gripping a white metal handrail with one hand, suggesting he is climbing onto the boat. His expression is cheerful and energetic, possibly sharing a moment of excitement from his snorkeling experience.\n\nHe is also wearing a wristwatch on his left arm, which is visible and adds to the details indicating an active, aquatic recreational setting. The background shows the deep blue color of the ocean, hinting at a bright, sunny day conducive to water activities. The composition of the image focuses closely on the man and the upper portion of the boat, using a shallow depth of field to blur the background and emphasize the subject in the foreground.","title":"Snorkeling scientist from Shell Oil Company about to examine formations of a coral reef, using the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park near Key Largo as his laboratory.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548726","547134","553783","548770","549359","555833","549331","546304","545179","557481","554006","544351","543065","544973","548714","555832"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","snorkel","handrail","wristwatch","mask","excitement","tube","vest","experience","man"]}
