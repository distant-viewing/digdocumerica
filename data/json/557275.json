{"path":"557275.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This image captures a tranquil evening scene at a riverbank with a picturesque silhouette style presentation. The sky, filled with clouds, shows in a palette of deep purples, oranges, and blues, indicating that it is either a sunset or a sunrise. Below this dramatic sky, a large bridge with a semi-circular arch can be seen connecting two land masses. The silhouette of a hill, possibly with vegetation, is noticeable behind the bridge.\n\nOn the riverside, there is a broad promenade where several people are visible as dark silhouettes, suggesting a leisurely activity, possibly walking or gathering around. The people are mostly standing or moving along the river bank; their activities are not distinctly visible due to the silhouette effect but give a sense of peaceful communal gathering or casual strolling. The atmosphere conveyed is serene and communal, typical of a scenic outdoor setting during pleasant weather.","title":"Sunset comes to the point of the Golden Triangle. The city was given the new reference in the early 1950's during the urban renewal renaissance program. The triangle is formed where the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers meet to form the Ohio River. The park there offers sightseeing, boating, wailing and relaxation.","placename":"Pittsburgh (Pa.)","location":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","nn1":["546625","552263","546392","552597","544722","555937","545145","557239","550771","555727","547217","543062","542995","557096","552598","543050"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["silhouette","bridge","masse","presentation","riverside","sunrise","arch","outdoor","purple","riverbank"]}
