{"path":"542621.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a rural setting, likely capturing a mining or industrial facility surrounded by a residential area and natural landscape. Prominently in the center, there is a large, conical structure resembling an old-fashioned mining headframe with an adjacent smokestack emitting white smoke, suggesting operational machinery. Surrounding this central structure are several low, industrial-style buildings, likely warehouses or processing facilities, cluttered with various equipment and materials.\n\nBeyond the industrial area, the scene includes a residential neighborhood composed of single-story houses, distributed amidst a network of roads. Each house is spaced out, with ample yard space, and there's a visible sense of community with cars parked along the streets and driveways.\n\nThe landscape around the built areas features rolling hills, predominantly dry grasslands with scattered trees, typical of a semi-rural environment. The overall atmosphere captures a blend of industrial activity within a peaceful, pastoral setting, illustrating the coexistence of work and residential life in a small town or countryside area. The light and shadows indicate either early morning or late afternoon, adding a serene quality to the image.","title":"Old style \"wigwam\" burner, Yancey Lumber Co.","placename":"Tollhouse (Calif.)","location":"Tollhouse, California","nn1":["542620","544059","543764","545354","545437","557379","554763","551049","542935","543668","543733","558054","553968","557374","544502","543872"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["mining","driveway","countryside","grassland","house","distribute","facility","coexistence","space","warehouse"]}
