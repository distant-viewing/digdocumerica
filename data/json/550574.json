{"path":"550574.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a large-scale industrial or mining landscape characterized by numerous parallel ridges of unearthed material, likely soil or other aggregates. The terrain appears deeply sculpted, showcasing rows of ridged mounds that stretch across the image in a repetitive, wave-like pattern. These mounds display varying shades of earthy browns and grays, suggesting different soil compositions or moisture levels.\n\nIn the image, there are also pockets of water collected between some mounds, reflecting the sky and adding a contrasting element to the dry, textured ridges. This suggests recent excavation activities or natural erosion effects.\n\nThe surroundings of the site are bordered by dense greenery, indicating that this area might be located near a forested region. The vegetation mainly consists of what looks like mature trees, possibly indicating that the site is relatively isolated or set away from urban development.\n\nThere is no visible presence of machinery or people; the focus is purely on the terrain and the environmental impact of the activities. The overall scene evokes a sense of the scale and intensity of human intervention in natural landscapes, typically for resource extraction or similar purposes.","title":"Detail of the gravel mounds that mark the passage of the placer gold rush era near Fairbanks.
