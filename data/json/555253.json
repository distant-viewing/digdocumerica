{"path":"555253.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside what appears to be a laboratory or pharmacy. The focus is on a man dressed in a white lab coat, standing in front of a large, vertical, glass-door cabinet filled with numerous bottles and containers. These jars and bottles vary in size and are labeled, indicating they contain different substances or chemicals.\n\nThe man is examining one smaller bottle closely, holding it with one hand and possibly adjusting the lid with the other. His posture suggests careful attention, indicative of his professional responsibility in handling or selecting these chemical substances.\n\nThe cabinet has several shelves, fully stocked with neatly organized rows of containers. Some labels are distinctly visible, showing chemical names, possibly used for research or pharmaceutical purposes.\n\nThe background is relatively plain, with a focus on another set of shelves packed with similar bottles and a glimpse of a desk or workstation at the end, partially obscured by the man's body. The lighting in the room appears fluorescent, common in laboratory settings, which helps in highlighting the details on the bottles and the overall cleanliness and organization of the space.\n\nThe mood conveyed is one of quiet diligence, typical of a scientific or medical setting where precise work and attention to detail are paramount. Overall, the scene illustrates a professional environment devoted to scientific or pharmaceutical activities.","title":"Cabinets for storage of pesticide \"standards\" at the environmental protection agency Mississippi test facility laboratory in bay st.
