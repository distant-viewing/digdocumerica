{"path":"545947.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph shows a unique, large, tracked vehicle that is partially covered by a facility's structure. The vehicle is predominantly white and red, with detailed labeling indicating it is a \"Module Air Cushion Research Vehicle\" associated with the Department of Transportation â€“ Federal Railroad Administration. It also bears the name \"Grumman\" on the side, suggesting the manufacturer.\n\nThe vehicle is equipped with a substantial track system, which appears heavy-duty and robust, similar to that found on tanks or large construction equipment. It's designed for operation on an air cushion, hinting at technology similar to that used by hovercrafts. The vehicle's body is sleek, aerodynamic, and elongated, suggestive of high-speed or efficient travel designs.\n\nIn the background, there's the interior of an industrial or maintenance facility with visible tools and construction elements, including beams and metal parts. The overall setting suggests that this vehicle is either under maintenance, construction, or housed for storage or display in a workshop or hangar environment. The lighting is artificial and bright, focusing on the vehicle, highlighting its structure and design features.","title":"Tracked air cushion research vehicle inside test area at the Department of Transportation's high speed ground test center. The experimental vehicle rides on a cushion of air and is propelled by a linear induction motor. It is being tested as a low-pollutant alternative to the autoMobile.","placename":"Pueblo (Colo.)","location":"Pueblo, Colorado","nn1":["545956","545946","545942","545948","545960","545931","545939","557472","545964","549779","552030","555986","556891","544061","552794","545935"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["vehicle","construction","maintenance","cushion","facility","workshop","speed","duty","technology","design"]}
