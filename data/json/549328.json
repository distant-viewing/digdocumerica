{"path":"549328.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a large group of people posed outdoors in what appears to be a casual and jovial setting. Roughly 24 individuals are shown, both men and women, of various ages, encompassing a range of expressions from smiling to laughter.\n\nThe group is systematically organized into three slightly overlapping rows, with most individuals seated or kneeling, and a few standing in the back. Their attire is casual, with many wearing plain, light-colored shirts and blouses, which suggests a warm climate or setting. Some individuals are dressed more formally, in button-down shirts.\n\nThis gathering takes place in front of a building made of concrete blocks, partially seen in the top right background under a large, corrugated metal canopy. This suggests a public or industrial-like location rather than a residential setting. Large coils of rope are prominently displayed in the foreground and around which many of the people are posed, indicating that the location might be related to marine, agricultural, or industrial work.\n\nThe general ambiance is friendly and communal, suggestive of a workplace team or a community group photographed possibly during a special event or gathering.","title":"The staff of the Rovenj, Yugoslavia branch of the Rudjer Boskovic Institute.
