{"path":"546806.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image captures a detailed view of a water surface that appears heavily polluted or disturbed. The water is a dark shade, almost black, suggesting it might be taken at night or in a shadowed area. Across the whole surface, there are gleaming patches that catch the light, likely oil or a similar substance due to the iridescent sheen and the patterns it createsâ€”circular whorls and streaks reminiscent of typical oil spills.\n\nEmbedded in this contaminated water are bits of debris and objects, specifically pieces of white, foamy material, possibly polystyrene or another type of synthetic floatation device that breaks apart in water. These pieces are scattered throughout the image, contributing to the overall sense of pollution and environmental damage depicted. The photo communicates a powerful message about water contamination and its visible consequences on the ecosystem.","title":"Dead menhaden floating along the tide line just north of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["555784","547617","547614","544175","547537","546015","550734","551560","545119","548090","550807","551561","550812","544580","555848","544779"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["oil","contaminate","consequence","contamination","piece","gleam","embed","spill","water","sheen"]}
