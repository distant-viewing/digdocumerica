{"path":"555546.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene featuring three people actively engaged in what appears to be a gardening setting or a casual outdoor gathering. To the left of the image, an older man stands, casually dressed in a white T-shirt with visible stains and blue jeans; he is adjusting or handling a camera, indicating a moment of leisure or capturing memories. In the middle of the image stands a young boy, possibly in his early adolescent years, smiling slightly while crossed arms and wearing a light blue and white striped T-shirt.\n\nTo the right, another boy who looks to be around the same age as the first one, is dressed in a blue and white striped tank top, leaning slightly towards the middle boy, attentively looking down, maybe at something in his hand or on the ground. All three are casually dressed, suitable for outdoor activity or work.\n\nThe setting includes grass and a cultivated plot of land, perhaps a garden, with visible tall plants and what appears to be a border made from old logs or wood, suggesting a home garden. The background is relatively undefined, suggestive of a rural or suburban environment, providing a quiet, private space for family or friends to gather. The lighting, marked by shadows and the greens of the vegetation, contributes to a peaceful late afternoon or early evening ambiance.","title":"Truck farming family views their contaminated garden after a nearby Pennwalt Corporation chemical storage building was desTroyed by fire and explosions believed caused by a strike of lightning on June 20, 1974. Rain and fire-fighting efforts caused chemicals to spill into a storm drain and the Olentangy River resulting in a major fish kill. EPA authorities supervised the cleanup.","placename":"Delaware (Ohio)","location":"Delaware, Ohio","nn1":["547398","556525","551027","556356","543238","547391","552033","551004","558187","549298","555819","542564","545088","543164","554026","543467"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["boy","garden","memory","stain","gardening","friend","plot","year","border","one"]}
