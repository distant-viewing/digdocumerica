{"path":"549278.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures a daytime scene of a busy highway, likely from an overpass or similar elevation. The highway is divided, with multiple lanes in both directions. The traffic includes several vehicles: cars of various models and colors, and a prominent yellow truck in the nearest lane.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there are two roadside billboards. The closest one advertises Ramada Inn with an illustration of a cocktail glass, and behind it is another less discernible sign. Alongside the road, street lamps and some signage are visible.\n\nThe right side of the highway features a large sign that provides direction for towns including Revere, Lynn, and Winthrop, indicating the exits to these locations. There is a parking lot visible beyond the highway barrier, filled with numerous parked cars and bounded by a row of trees.\n\nThe sky is clear with few clouds, suggesting good weather conditions. The overall atmosphere of the image is dynamic, typical of a bustling urban expressway setting, capturing the essence of mid to late 20th-century American roadways.","title":"Looking northeast across Route C1 elevated highway.
