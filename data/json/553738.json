{"path":"553738.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling outdoor scene, likely of a group of tourists or a tour group gathered in an urban setting. The majority are wearing vibrant pink leis around their necks, suggesting they may be part of a special event or visiting the area as a part of a coordinated activity.\n\nThe group consists of numerous individuals, mostly seen standing and walking around. They are dressed in a mix of casual and semi-formal attire, including jackets, blouses, slacks, and dresses. The scene is lively with interactions among the group members.\n\nIn the foreground and mid-ground, there are several tables set up with various items displayed on them, possibly souvenirs or local goods for sale. These tables attract the attention of some individuals in the group.\n\nThe background features a city street that curves away from the foreground, bordered by a sidewalk where the group is gathered. A large directional arrow sign on the road points to the left, implying the presence of vehicular traffic directions or lanes. There are no prominent buildings or landmarks visible, giving the setting a generic urban feel. The composition is filled with activity and color, centered on the cultural or tourist experience.","title":"Honolulu international airport handles almost all of the island's visitors.
