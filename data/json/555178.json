{"path":"555178.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph displays a close-up view of a natural setting, prominently featuring a cluster of decomposing leaves. These leaves appear weathered and dried, with a crinkled texture and a color palette that blends shades of pale grey, white, and hints of underlying brown. Their curled and overlapping arrangement suggests that they have been undisturbed for a while and subjected to natural decay processes.\n\nThe leaves are scattered amongst a bed of dark soil and small stones. The soil is moist and rich in color, which contrasts with the pale, desaturated look of the leaves. Among these elements, small green plants can be seen emerging, possibly new growth flourishing in the nutrient-rich decaying matter.\n\nThe background of the photo is mostly filled with similar elementsâ€”soil, stones, and bits of green foliage, contributing to a somber yet intriguing depiction of decomposition in a natural environment. The overall composition of the photograph focuses on detailing this micro-habitat, highlighting the cycle of life and decay in nature.","title":"Puffballs growing on land that was clear+cut a year earlier, in the olympic national timberland, Washington.
