{"path":"553098.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a casual and cozy scene inside a laundromat. A young woman, with shoulder-length dark hair, is seated at a small formica table that has a patterned cover, suggesting a setting that sees regular use for customers waiting for their laundry. She is wearing a light blue terrycloth robe and smiles slightly as she looks off to her side, adding a relaxed and everyday feel to the image.\n\nBeside her, a medium-sized German Shepherd dog lies on the floor, appearing content and at ease in the environment. This presence of the dog provides a homely sense, indicating the laundromat is pet-friendly and frequented by neighborhood locals.\n\nIn the background, multiple washing machines line the wall, identifiable by their large circular doors and green exteriors. These machines are standard for such an establishment, and they emphasize the functionality of the space.\n\nOverall, this image portrays an ordinary moment of domestic life, highlighting a sense of community and simplicity. The lighting in the scene is natural and subdued, enhancing the candid and unposed atmosphere of the photograph.","title":"Paiute woman at the laundromat in nixon, Pyramid Lake indian reservation","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["557356","554193","557637","553481","552611","553546","556413","547950","556171","556421","556576","553485","545985","544356","543041","552114"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["dog","machine","washing","pet","laundry","ease","local","frequent","robe","customer"]}
