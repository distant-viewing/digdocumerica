{"path":"545716.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a natural outdoor setting focused on a bush with tall, slender, vertical flowering spikes. The flowers are mostly yellow, transitioning to green towards the bottom. Surrounding the central plant are various other wild grasses and smaller bushes, predominantly in shades of green, brown, and hints of yellow, suggesting it might be late summer or early autumn. The background contains darker, dense shrubbery and trees, which are not in sharp focus, giving a soft contrast to the vividly detailed foreground. The upper right corner seems to open up to a lighter, possibly sky-filled area, suggesting that the setting might be within a clearing or edge of a wooded area. The overall atmosphere is serene, portraying a wild, natural environment.","title":"Prince's plume","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["557098","551370","557191","555187","547642","549230","544875","555186","544443","558079","554745","557782","555040","542615","544938","554743"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flowering","lighter","bush","wild","shrubbery","clearing","open","transition","autumn","wooded"]}
