{"path":"547091.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic seascape during either sunrise or sunset. The scene is oriented along a coastal barrier or jetty, which is partially submerged by choppy, swirling waters. Strong waves are crashing against the structure, sending sprays of water into the air, which catch the light and create a shimmering effect. The barrier, consisting of closely spaced, sturdy pillars, stretches from the foreground into the distance.\n\nThe sunlight, which is low on the horizon, bathes the scene in a warm, reddish hue, suggesting either early morning or late evening light. This light accentuates the textures and motion of the water and also creates a reflective path across the waterâ€™s surface that leads towards the sun.\n\nThe background features a clear sky with a hint of slight cloudiness near the horizon line, emphasizing the tranquility and expansiveness beyond the turbulence at the barrier. Additionally, there's a structure visible in the distance, parallel to the jetty, which could be a bridge or another type of long, man-made object. \n\nOverall, the composition uses natural light and the dynamics of water to craft a scene that is both serene and powerful. The elements combine to focus on the interplay between the man-made structure and the natural force of the sea, enhanced by the dramatic lighting and rich colors of the time of day.","title":"Breakwater in Michigan city","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547143","542808","543138","553852","547147","553992","547483","545030","557510","543060","543019","544985","542890","545022","543251","543304"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["barrier","jetty","turbulence","expansiveness","water","seascape","crash","dynamic","pillar","craft"]}
