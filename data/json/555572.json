{"path":"555572.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph shows a rugged outdoor scene with a striking landscape primarily characterized by a vast, bowl-shaped valley that fills much of the background. The valley is made up of rounded hills that appear heavily eroded with loose, dark earth and some sparse vegetation visible. These hills form a large basin, and in the foreground, there’s a collection of rocks and debris, suggesting recent work or disturbance in the area.\n\nIn the foreground, two vehicles are visible, which seem to be involved in some form of construction or excavation. On the left side of the image, there's a bulldozer with visible caterpillar tracks and a protective roof; it seems to be either moving earth or clearing debris. On the right, closer to a small body of water, there’s a truck equipped with what appears to be various tools or machinery. This small pond or lake is nestled at the foot of the valley and is surrounded by a few trees, which are some of the only significant vegetation apparent in the scene.\n\nThe overall setting suggests a remote or sparsely populated area possibly used for mining, construction, or some form of industrial activity. The sky above is mostly clear with only a thin wisp of cloud, indicating fair weather, which casts bright sunlight over the landscape.","title":"Strip mined land being recontoured by equipment from the coal companies off route #100.","placename":"Morristown (Belmont County, Ohio)","location":"Morristown, Ohio","nn1":["549170","554804","545677","549180","544418","549255","549179","552004","545533","547254","547591","554765","555610","547523","555608","543760"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["valley","wisp","form","earth","bowl","basin","construction","erode","debris","bulldozer"]}
