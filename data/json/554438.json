{"path":"554438.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil scene of a rustic woodland cabin situated beside a calm body of water, possibly a lake or pond. The cabin, showing signs of weathering, has a brown exterior with white trim around its windows and a small chimney protruding from the roof. It appears to be elevated slightly on stilts or a foundation, suggesting the area might be prone to moisture or flooding.\n\nSurrounding the cabin, dense forest trees predominantly composed of evergreens provide a lush backdrop, indicating the location is likely in a forested or mountainous area. The cabin's immediate vicinity includes various elements such as a wheelbarrow, suggesting ongoing work or maintenance, and possibly a metal barrel, signifying storage or trash disposal.\n\nIn the foreground, the edge of the water is visible with some aquatic plants along the bank, enhancing the natural, untouched feel of the environment. The reflection of the cabin on the waterâ€™s surface adds to the peaceful and secluded atmosphere of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes a serene escape into nature, where the cabin serves as a modest retreat in the midst of a dense woodland area by the water.","title":"A tar-paper camp--example of unregulated building, without regard to distance from shoreline or aesthetic planning.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554696","544567","545137","554401","557783","554084","557691","543527","552987","554788","544865","550778","555231","543543","557562","549193"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["cabin","evergreen","escape","stilt","foundation","retreat","flooding","disposal","woodland","barrel"]}
