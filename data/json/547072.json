{"path":"547072.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a tender moment between a woman and a young boy in an outdoor setting, likely a park. The woman, dressed in a light-colored trench coat with her long hair flowing down, is bending forward to embrace the boy. She holds him close, her forehead softly resting against his head. The boy, wearing a dark sweater and jeans, seems to be comforted by her gesture, as he stands still with his head inclined towards her.\n\nThe background of the photo features a verdant park environment with the onset of spring or fall, suggested by the mild barrenness of the trees. A red park bench sits on the left, while a partial view of a playground is visible towards the middle of the background, including what looks like swings. The scene is quiet, with a deserted walking path and a white car parked in the distance, providing a tranquil, somewhat introspective atmosphere to the scene. The pathways and grass areas are quite extensive, indicating that this is a sizeable park designed for recreational activities and relaxation.","title":"Comfort for a small mishap at Lincoln park.
