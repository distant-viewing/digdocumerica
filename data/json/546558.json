{"path":"546558.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a quiet and moody scene inside what appears to be a public building, possibly a gallery or a library. The focus is on a lone female figure standing near the center of the image. She is dressed in a light pink suit and appears to be observing something to her right.\n\nThe hall in which she stands is dimly lit, marked by dark walls and a glossy, reflective floor. Sunlight or artificial light streams in from the left, creating a brighter area that highlights the woman and the floor near her. The ceiling features an arched design, painted in a darker hue that contrasts with the brighter walls and floor in the center area. A series of framed pictures or documents line the walls on both sides, although it's difficult to make out the details due to the low lighting.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photo conveys a sense of solitude and contemplation. The use of lighting enhances the dramatic and somewhat somber tone of the composition. The scene is quiet and devoid of any prominent action, emphasizing the stillness and the presence of the woman as she engages with her surroundings.","title":"In the frances smith elementary school \"tube-ramps\" take children from one level to another","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546564","546498","546576","546479","546528","553534","546554","546471","546526","557723","544437","545373","551337","556048","556017","546462"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["floor","wall","library","hall","woman","document","stillness","ceiling","contemplation","stream"]}
