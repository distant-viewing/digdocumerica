{"path":"544988.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures two men standing on a pebble-covered beach. The individual on the left appears to be middle-aged and is wearing sunglasses, a striped button-up shirt, and dark pants. He is slightly turned towards the camera with a serious expression. The man on the right, also middle-aged, is wearing a light blue button-up shirt with a pocket and glasses. He is facing the camera directly and has a neutral expression.\n\nThe background reveals a serene beach scene with gentle waves and a curved shoreline that recedes into the distance. The beach is lined with dense forests that climb up a steep incline. The sky is clear and bright, suggesting it might be midday given the brilliance of the sunlight and mild shadows on the subjects' faces.\n\nThe beach is devoid of typical sandy textures, instead covered in smooth, rounded pebbles that extend from the foreground, where the men stand, into the distance where the beach meets the forest edge. The ambiance is quiet and natural, with no visible signs of modern human activity other than the two men in the scene. The overall mood is one of calmness and isolation in a natural coastal environment.","title":"Guy McMinds, a fisheries scientist, and his associate Brian Allee","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547189","547943","543237","543492","548622","545194","543252","557470","550826","555402","557509","543474","547612","543225","547697","552286"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","pebble","button","incline","man","pocket","climb","forest","calmness","camera"]}
