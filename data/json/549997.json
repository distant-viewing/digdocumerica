{"path":"549997.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph features a captivating urban scene vividly portraying contrasting architectural styles within a city. In the foreground, a traditional, historic stone building with a complex roof structure and detailed stonework appears. This structure has elements typical of Victorian-era architecture, including arched windows and a steeply pitched roof. Adjacent to it is another segment of the building with a large green-roofed porch supported by columns.\n\nThe middle ground shows a transitional space that could be a street or urban park, highlighted by the presence of a couple of nondescript vehicles and a few pedestrians.\n\nDominating the background is a striking modern skyscraper that rises dramatically into the sky. The building's surface is a reflective glass facade, mirroring the older structure before it and the surrounding environment. The skyscraper's sleek, mirror-like exterior contrasts sharply with the texture and color of the historic building in the foreground.\n\nThe composition cleverly showcases the juxtaposition between old and new architectural elements, reflecting on the evolution of urban landscapes. The contrast not only in architectural styles but also in materials – reflective glass versus rugged stone – emphasizes themes of time and progress. The sky and incidental fluffs of clouds mirrored in the skyscraper's glass add a light, airy element to the otherwise dense urban setting.","title":"The old john hancock building is reflected in the glass front of the new john hancock building","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["551442","550062","546521","550001","550007","552042","550011","546499","549880","551455","550024","545869","547229","557271","545380","553557"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["skyscraper","mirror","glass","roof","evolution","stone","stonework","building","progress","pitch"]}
