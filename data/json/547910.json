{"path":"547910.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a quiet residential street, focusing primarily on a prominent \"Private Property, No Trespassing\" sign attributed to the Breezy Point Cooperative, Inc. The sign, with its bold white letters on a dark, reflective background, is centrally positioned in the frame, mounted on a metal post.\n\nIn the background of the sign, there are residential homes lined up along the street. The houses are predominantly single-story, with varying designs and appearances. One house directly behind the sign features a visible porch with a fence, and others further down the road have similar small front yards. The architecture style is modest, typical of many suburban neighborhoods.\n\nThe street itself appears narrow, paved, and bordered by a sidewalk, which is where the viewer's perspective seems to be. A wooden picket fence is visible along the left side of the photograph, running parallel to the path and complementing the residential, homey feel of the area.\n\nUtility poles and overhead wires stretch across the frame, intersecting the sky and adding a sense of everyday suburban infrastructure. There are also bare trees visible, suggesting that the photograph might have been taken in late fall or early spring when the trees are not fully leafed out, contributing to the slightly stark, quiet atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition creates a clear foreground dominated by the no trespassing sign, with a detailed, yet subdued, residential scene forming the middle and background layers. The mood conveyed is one of orderly calmness and private residential life.","title":"Breezy point cooperative is a seasonal residential community on the relatively untouched and unpolluted breezy point Peninsula","placename":"Queens (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Queens, New York","nn1":["554103","548845","557441","556950","544245","544263","548846","548836","547567","548248","552076","544262","555582","545159","550099","553344"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["trespassing","sign","street","attribute","fence","picket","house","leaf","calmness","property"]}
