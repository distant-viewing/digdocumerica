{"path":"554233.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph depicts a picturesque winter scene where a large multi-story house is nestled amidst a snowy forest landscape. The house, which appears cozy and residential, features prominent balconies on each level, with wooden railings and surrounded by extensive snow cover. It seems well integrated into the natural environment with its rustic wooden architecture and position among the bare trees, which are leafless, likely due to the cold winter season.\n\nThe surroundings are blanketed in a thick layer of snow, indicating recent heavy snowfall. Tall thin trees fill the background and foreground of the photo, creating a somewhat dense woodland area. Portions of the house's roof and the nearby ground accumulate a layer of untouched snow, emphasizing the quiet and undisturbed nature of the setting.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it might be taken on a bright sunny day, given the vibrancy and shadows cast on the snow, enhancing the serene and tranquil atmosphere of the winter scene. There are no visible footprints or signs of recent activity, adding to the secluded and peaceful vibe of the location. The general mood conveyed is one of winter solitude and the beauty of natural landscapes during the snow-covered months.","title":"This home on Snowmass Mountain is ideally located--just 100 yards from the ski lift.","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554232","556645","554213","554281","556644","543755","553458","554288","543526","557669","552607","557326","557608","554249","552986","543610"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["snow","winter","house","snowfall","month","layer","footprint","vibrancy","balcony","cover"]}
