{"path":"548516.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a serene nautical scene, predominantly featuring a sailboat and a navigation marker in a vast body of water under an overcast sky. The sailboat, positioned near the center of the frame, is a medium-sized vessel with twin masts but without any sails hoisted, suggesting it might be motoring or at rest. There are several people visible on the deck of the boat, engaged in what seems to be casual activities, possibly maintenance or preparation.\n\nTo the right of the sailboat is a navigation marker - a pole sticking out of the water with a light or beacon on top, likely serving as a guide for maritime navigation. The water appears calm with gentle ripples, and the backdrop is a hazy sky, possibly indicating foggy or misty weather conditions. The overall atmosphere is quiet and somewhat moody, characteristic of a peaceful maritime environment. The framing and focus of the photograph emphasize the isolation and tranquility of the sailboat in its vast watery surroundings.","title":"Chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["545900","548521","549380","544667","553991","547273","542903","549411","552050","548247","549374","544669","548118","552345","548733","545057"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","navigation","marker","twin","foggy","hoist","motor","mast","misty","stick"]}
