{"path":"550311.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, foggy landscape where the elements merge into a palette of muted colors under an overcast sky. At the right forefront, a quaint white house with a gabled roof and multiple chimneys sits nestled among a few sparse trees and low shrubs. Its windows are simple and symmetrically placed, adding to the humble and traditional architectural style of the building.\n\nTo the left of the house, a curved unpaved road winds its way gently through the scene, disappearing into the fog-shrouded distance where another building is faintly visible. This secondary building also appears to be white with a similar style, contributing to a coherent visual theme in the area.\n\nTall coniferous trees, typical of a cooler, temperate climate, dot the landscape. The overall greenery, though subdued by the fog, enhances the rural, pastoral feel of the scene. The atmospheric conditions, with dense fog and muted light, create a serene, almost ethereal quality, enveloping the scene in a soft, purple-hued mist, which suggests either an early morning or late evening time.\n\nThere are no visible humans or animals, which underscores a sense of quiet solitude and abandonment in this rural setting. The image evokes a touch of nostalgia and tranquility, ideal for reflective and peaceful moods. The overall composition with its curving lines, traditional structures, and natural elements, framed by the fog, offers a timeless glimpse into a calm, understated countryside life.","title":"Fog blots out the harbor at cutler, fishing and resort village south of eastport","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["557025","557023","554767","554721","556425","557013","556985","556962","556957","545041","554401","558110","550704","547292","555536","557946"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["fog","disappear","countryside","nostalgia","house","ideal","shroud","merge","purple","envelop"]}
