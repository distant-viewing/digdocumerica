{"path":"551986.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"The photograph depicts two older men engaged in work on a wooden dock. The man on the left is closely inspecting or possibly repairing a piece of wood, bent over it with a serious focus, possibly using a tool. The man on the right is also focused on another piece of wood, similarly engaged in a task that requires careful attention, possibly measuring or marking. Both are wearing long-sleeve shirts and trousers, suitable for manual labor.\n\nThe background of the photograph features a maritime scene. There's a body of water visible, and on this waterway, a small tugboat is moving, centered in the frame behind the two men. This tugboat seems to be towing a barge labeled \"Bulcher Fijo\". In the distance, there are large industrial structures, likely shipbuilding facilities or warehouses, with cranes and construction visible, suggesting an industrial port area.\n\nThe overall setting implies a working environment, possibly a shipyard or a similar industrial marine setting, where these men might be performing maintenance or construction tasks related to marine and dockside activities.","title":"The Texas eastern gas tank (in background) on Staten Island as seen from the opposite side of Arthur Kill at port reading","placename":"New Jersey","location":"New Jersey","nn1":["552863","546818","552874","552149","546802","547164","552148","546758","552115","552877","548250","546774","551046","546307","543465","551228"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["tugboat","man","marine","shipyard","wood","task","tow","piece","construction","measure"]}
