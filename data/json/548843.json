{"path":"548843.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph shows a middle-aged man walking on top of a large, gray pipeline under a clear blue sky. The man is casually dressed, wearing a white shirt, dark pants, and shoes. He seems focused as he walks along the rounded surface of the pipe.\n\nThe pipeline extends into the distance on both sides, parallel lines creating a vanishing point. At the top of the pipe where the man is walking, there's a circular metal fixture secured with bolts. Other similar pipelines run alongside the one he is on, emphasizing the industrial nature of the setting.\n\nIn the background, the terrain is arid with small hills or rock formations, and there's scant vegetation, characteristic of a desert landscape. The presence of utility poles and other infrastructure elements suggests this could be a facility or a part of some extensive industrial operation, likely related to energy or resource transport.\n\nThe shadow of the photographer is visible in the foreground, cast on the pipeline, indicating bright overhead sunlight, typical of a desert environment during the day. This inclusion subtly adds a personal touch to the scene, providing a sense of perspective and the position of the observer.","title":"Metropolitan Water District pumping station near Parker Dam supplies drinking water to most of Southern California's communities.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["545615","542528","543170","546536","552432","549000","547949","549352","549118","547956","547571","543796","544094","544740","557388","557241"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pipeline","walk","pipe","desert","vanish","bolt","photographer","observer","inclusion","fixture"]}
