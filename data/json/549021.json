{"path":"549021.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph encompassing a rugged, mountainous terrain through which a serpentine body of water snakes. The water appears in brilliant shades of dark to turquoise blue, contrasting strikingly with the stark, arid mountains enclosing it. The landscape is characterized by steep, barren, and rocky hill formations with little to no vegetation, exhibiting hues ranging from deep browns to lighter sandy colors, usually typical of arid regions.\n\nThe river tightly winds through the mountains, suggesting erosion processes that might have shaped this stark valley over millennia. The topography dramatically undulates with ridges, peaks, and valleys, providing a textured natural pattern from this aerial vantage point. The photograph is likely taken from a significant height, as the scale of the terrain compared to the river suggests vastness and grandeur.\n\nThe overcast sky casts a somewhat muted light over the scene, softening the typically harsh shadows one might expect in such a place, thus enhancing a blend of subdued colors and tones throughout the composition. This birdâ€™s-eye view captures a dynamic and untouched wilderness, emphasizing the beauty and isolation of such remote natural landscapes.","title":"Colorado River below Hoover Dam","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["550561","544744","550508","550526","550487","550633","550529","542700","550523","550414","550593","545794","549456","542701","550498","544748"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["valley","turquoise","millennium","snake","dark","mountain","topography","river","ridge","grandeur"]}
