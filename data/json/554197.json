{"path":"554197.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"In the photograph, three people are engaged in an outdoor activity that involves handling a large net or textile, possibly in the process of drying or mending. The scene appears to take place in a rural setting, with trees and foliage visible in the background.\n\nTo the left, a man wearing a dark green shirt and jeans stands while gesturing towards the net. He seems to be discussing or explaining something about the net to the woman in front of him. The woman, positioned centrally with her back to the camera, has long curly hair and is dressed in a blue jacket and jeans, listening or observing closely.\n\nOn the right, another man in a black tank top and jeans stands alongside the net with one hand slightly raised toward the net, and appears to be handling it. His attention is directed towards the other two individuals, possibly participating in the conversation or activity.\n\nThe net itself is hung from a horizontal bar supported by vertical posts, and it's laden with strands that hang loose, suggesting it might be involved in some form of artisanal or practical craft, such as fishing. The environment gives a serene, naturalistic look to the scene, emphasizing a sense of rural or outdoor life. The ground is scattered with some debris, indicating an active work area.","title":"Herbert May with children and fishing nets","placename":"Lake of the Woods County (Minn.)","location":"Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota","nn1":["552807","552302","546360","546290","546340","552300","546330","552299","545085","551396","545208","548299","551386","551410","554109","552298"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["net","jean","handle","strand","involve","explain","discuss","bar","participate","craft"]}
