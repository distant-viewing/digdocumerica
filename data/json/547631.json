{"path":"547631.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a close view of a Pitcher Plant (Sarracenia), with its distinctively shaped leaves and vibrant flowers, thriving in a natural setting. The primary subject is the plant's red flower, which features deep red petals surrounding a dark, round center, likely the structure protecting the reproductive parts of the flower. A younger flower next to it is still enveloped tightly in green sepals with a hint of red, possibly not yet fully bloomed.\n\nAround the flowers, several green pitcher-shaped leaves, characteristic of the Pitcher Plant, are visible. These modified leaves typically serve to trap and digest insects, providing nutrients to the plant. The leaves have a slight sheen, suggesting a waxy or moist surface.\n\nThe plant is situated in a grassy area with an array of wild grass and other vegetation, indicative of a wetland or marsh-like environment. The background is subtly blurred, allowing the focus to remain squarely on the vibrant flower and its immediate surroundings, filled with natural green and brown tones that highlight the plantâ€™s presence against the less colorful background. \n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests daylight, possibly with the sun high in the sky, casting natural light that accentuates the vivid colors of the Pitcher Plant and contributes to the overall fresh and serene feel of the image.","title":"Pitcher plant blooms in putts bog.
