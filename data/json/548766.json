{"path":"548766.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The image shows a series of bright red buoy-like objects hanging from a rope against a dark wooden vertical backdrop, possibly a fence. These spherical objects, which resemble marine buoys, each have a slightly glossy finish and appear to be attached to the rope by smaller strings or cords. The ropes look somewhat worn and knotted, holding the red objects at different heights, creating a sort of decorative arrangement. \n\nThe red objects are dotted with white spots, suggesting that they might be wet or have been exposed to a spray, possibly indicating an outdoor setting. The backdrop is uniformly dark, serving to accentuate the vibrant red hue of the hanging objects. The overall composition of the photograph gives a sense of rustic charm, possibly indicating an outdoor or maritime setting.","title":"Freshly painted floats ornament lobster traps at Conch Key, a small island in the lower Florida Keys.
