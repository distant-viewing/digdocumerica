{"path":"551901.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph presents a scene inside a control room or surveillance station. On the prominent beige wall at the back, there are numerous black-and-white television screens arranged in a grid pattern. Each screen displays different imagery, likely CCTV or surveillance footage.\n\nIn the foreground, three men are seated at desks, focused on their tasks. Each desk is equipped with multiple pieces of equipment, possibly including monitors, switchboards, or control interfaces. The man in the foreground is right-handed and is using a pen to jot down notes on a large pad, referencing multiple documents in front of him.\n\nThe setting appears professional, suggesting a somewhat tense or concentrated work environment. The lighting is subdued, highlighting only the workers and the screens, while the rest of the room has softer light, enhancing the focus on the wall of monitors and the individuals at work.\n\nAdditional items such as telephones, office supplies, paperwork, and what appears to be technical instruments complement the workspace, indicating a highly specialized operational setting. There is also a standing ashtray, which places the scene in a period when indoor smoking in workplaces was still common. The overall ambiance suggests vigilance and surveillance, possibly in a security or communications hub. The aesthetic gives a vintage or retrospective feel, possibly dating back a few decades.","title":"The central police control station, manned 24 hours a day controls all traffic lights, receives remote tv inputs from major intersections, and maintains radio contact with all traffic control vehicles","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551902","551905","551904","551916","551896","551900","551903","556758","555334","552377","547720","551898","549367","556384","549378","545952"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["surveillance","screen","monitor","desk","room","control","smoking","paperwork","television","workplace"]}
