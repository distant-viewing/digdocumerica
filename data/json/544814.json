{"path":"544814.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph shows a suburban development mid-construction, presumably in a hilly area. In the foreground, there is a large promotional billboard reading \"6th Avenue West, A PLANNED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BY Ridgewood Realty, Inc. EXIT 2500 FEET SOUTH ON INDIANA.\" The billboard indicates the development is a planned community, giving a sense of an organized and pre-designed construction project. \n\nSurrounding the billboard, the terrain is largely muddy and undeveloped, indicative of early-stage construction. Several wooden, partially constructed buildings are visible in various stages of completion. These houses are similar in design, suggesting they are part of a uniform housing plan. Some are framed but don't yet have their exterior walls completed. \n\nIn the middle distance, more completed homes can be seen; these houses are further along in construction and are roofed with dark materials. Behind the residential area, at the top of a gentle slope, is a long building that appears to be a larger structure, possibly an apartment or a communal building still under construction, evident by its exposed wooden framing.\n\nThe background reveals a mountainous terrain, hinting at the location being near hills or mountains, common in regions with significant natural elevation changes. The sky is clear, suggesting good weather conditions which are favorable for construction activities. The overall composition of the photograph captures the essence of a new suburban area emerging from a raw landscape.","title":"New housing development","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["557550","547931","557455","553061","553922","553707","553934","553941","553706","547863","544118","557456","544600","544568","547664","553700"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["construction","billboard","complete","stage","completion","development","house","plan","exit","apartment"]}
