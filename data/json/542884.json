{"path":"542884.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and somewhat moody coastal scene, likely captured on an overcast day. The setting is a sandy beach with a variety of notable features. In the foreground, a large, weathered tree stump with a distinctive hole at its center dominates the composition. This stump, characterized by rugged, dark textures, indicates a long-standing exposure to the elements, suggesting it might have been part of a driftwood or been uprooted during a storm.\n\nSurrounding the stump are smaller rocks and debris scattered across the wet sand, which captures their reflections faintly. The sand itself shows signs of recent activity, possibly from the tide or wind, with smooth, undisturbed patches interspersed with areas of shallow indentations and tracks.\n\nIn the midground, more driftwood and a collection of large rock formations can be observed. These rocks, also dark and worn, contribute to the rugged natural beauty of the landscape. Some of them are substantial in size and have irregular shapes, giving the beach a dramatic and unrefined appeal.\n\nThe background is shrouded in a light fog or mist, which blurs the line between the sandy beach and the forest edge. This mist adds an element of mystery and tranquility to the scene. The beach extends into the distance, gently curving out of view, which might lead the viewerâ€™s eye toward the horizon, although the overcast sky merges seamlessly with the sea, obscuring any distinct horizon line.\n\nOverall, the image is imbued with a sense of quiet and isolation, emphasized by the muted colors and soft, diffuse light. It captures the rugged beauty typical of many coastal regions, highlighting the interplay between land and sea.","title":"California--Moonstone Beach","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["542887","542886","542889","543075","543078","543081","542888","543054","543090","543068","543287","543153","543069","542890","543091","543134"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["stump","beach","driftwood","rock","mist","sand","sea","hole","tide","appeal"]}
