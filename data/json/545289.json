{"path":"545289.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The image captures a landscape predominantly characterized by forest sections in varying conditions. In the forefront, there is an area of significant deforestation where trees have been cut down, leaving a bare, messy terrain littered with stumps and debris. This cleared area contrasts sharply with the intact dense forest of tall, dark green trees in the background, suggesting a boundary between disturbed and natural environments.\n\nThe scene is viewed perhaps from a higher vantage point or a slope, as indicated by partial views of tree branches and foliage at the top and the bottom of the frame, framing the main view and adding a natural border to the photograph. The angle provides a comprehensive perspective of the clearing and its impact on the landscape.\n\nAdditionally, there appears to be a narrow body of water, possibly a stream, reflecting light in the middle distance, running parallel to the forest edge. This body of water adds a reflective quality to the image, creating a natural division within the scenery. The illumination and color tones suggest this photo was taken in bright, possibly midday light, enhancing the vividness of natural greens and the starkness of the cleared area, emphasizing the environmental alteration depicted.","title":"A clear-cut and burned-over hillside one mile from the entrance to the Hoh Rain Forest. Although esthetically unpleasing this is basically good forestry practice. The slash is not too thick and will decompose fairly rapidly.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542833","555148","555150","555146","542834","542825","557574","542820","555085","555136","542840","545143","557001","555208","542865","545264"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["forest","starkness","deforestation","division","alteration","stump","illumination","midday","vividness","border"]}
