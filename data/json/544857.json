{"path":"544857.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph portrays a serene, rural landscape with a significant scenic contrast between different natural elements.\n\nIn the foreground, there are lush green fields and hills dotted with scrub and trees, suggesting early to mid-spring, when foliage starts to bloom. A focal point is a small village or a cluster of farm buildings positioned almost centrally in the bottom third of the frame. The buildings, including barns and fenced enclosures, give the impression of a working ranch or farm community.\n\nRising behind this pastoral lower section is a range of imposing mountains, covered with snow, indicating their elevation and possibly the time of year being late spring or even early summer at lower altitudes. The mountains dominate the background and provide a dramatic backdrop to the calmness of the valley below. Their rugged peaks are well-defined against a largely clear sky, with just a few clouds.\n\nThe composition of the image, with its vast and open foreground leading up to the dramatic, snow-capped mountains, conveys a strong sense of the varying geography and height across the landscape. This contrast emphasizes the remote and possibly isolated nature of the location, showcasing the vast, undisturbed wilderness. \n\nOverall, the photograph captures a tranquil but dynamic rural landscape, highlighting the beauty and harshness of natural environments.","title":"Uncompahgre Mountains","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["543763","553073","556341","543720","550497","550516","544905","543654","550511","550441","550510","553811","552582","550415","554722","552593"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["farm","spring","mountain","snow","geography","harshness","ranch","scrub","village","enclosure"]}
