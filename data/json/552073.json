{"path":"552073.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene at a disheveled location filled with debris and several abandoned and damaged vehicles. The ground is muddy with numerous puddles reflecting the surroundings. It is littered extensively with scattered waste, including tires, pieces of metal, discarded papers, and other miscellaneous rubbish.\n\nSeveral old cars, from around the mid-20th century, appear in varying states of neglect and disrepair. The vehicles are mostly intact but show signs of wear, rust, and long-term exposure to the elements. The colors of the cars include burgundy, white, and blue. The overall arrangement of cars and debris suggests abandonment and lack of maintenance, possibly in a junkyard or a similarly neglected area.\n\nIn the background, a large bridge stretches across a body of water, suggesting that this scene is near a river or estuary. The architecture of the bridge is metallic with trusses, likely designed for both vehicle and possibly train traffic.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of disarray and decay, highlighting environmental neglect or the aftermath of economic downturns affecting the area. The weather appears overcast, contributing to the gloomy and abandoned feel of the scene.","title":"AutoMobile junkyard on the north bank of the Kansas river between the 12th and 18th street bridges","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["552072","546173","555851","555850","544433","542590","555870","547601","544060","546816","547587","547597","546913","543680","555492","545340"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["cars","abandon","neglected","neglect","estuary","bridge","vehicle","desig","junkyard","rubbish"]}
