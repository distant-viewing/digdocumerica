{"path":"546405.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an abandoned car overtaken by nature. The scene is framed by tall, dense trees with thick foliage, creating a lush green backdrop and a slightly dark atmosphere due to the shade they provide. The foreground features a white, vintage car in a state of neglect. It is partially submerged or sunk into the ground, surrounded by overgrown grass and wild plants that seem to be reclaiming the area.\n\nThe car appears to be an old model, possibly from the early to mid-20th century, characterized by its rounded shape and distinctive front grill design. Its paint is faded and chipped in several places, adding to the feel of decay. The vehicle's hood is missing, and its front windshield is completely broken or absent, allowing plants to grow inside it. To the right side of the frame, a bit of another broken car part (possibly another piece of the same vehicle or a different one) is visible amidst the overgrowth.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of abandonment and the relentless reclaiming of human-made objects by nature. The mood is somewhat melancholic, highlighting themes of decay and the passage of time.","title":"Abandoned car, off highway in Rio GRande","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"San Juan, Puero Rico","nn1":["553008","550797","553002","548751","550795","547747","545540","549107","553007","554920","548750","546318","547024","553010","546315","547771"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","decay","break","overgrowth","sink","grill","reclaim","windshield","chip","miss"]}
