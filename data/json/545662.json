{"path":"545662.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a large-scale outdoor construction or cleanup project. The scene is set in a rugged landscape with a backdrop of mountains partially obscured by low clouds or mist. The terrain in the foreground consists of muddy, cleared ground interspersed with areas of standing water, indicating a wet environment possibly after recent rainfall or near a water body.\n\nCentral to the image is a yellow bulldozer facing the viewer; it is covered in mud and positioned at the edge of a bank, suggesting it has been used for moving earth or clearing debris. Directly to the left and slightly in the background is another piece of heavy machinery, also yellow, but this appears inactive and is partly cut off by the frame of the photograph.\n\nAcross the scene, several workers are present, wearing protective clothing such as helmets and visible from a distance - they are smaller in scale compared to the machinery, highlighting the expansive scale of the project. Some workers are operating equipment or are near machinery, whereas others are walking or standing, indicating various ongoing activities.\n\nIn the background, another large vehicle or crane can be seen, further emphasizing the sizable nature of the operation. Electric generators and various tools lie scattered throughout the area, indicating ongoing work and preparation. The overall mood is one of industrial activity, set against a remote and harsh natural environment. The cloudy skies and rugged terrain contribute to a somber and hardworking atmosphere.","title":"Dragline scoops up debris at log boom site near northeast tip of Lake Powell following massive oil spill into the San Juan River. Spill originated from burst pipeline 200 miles upstream. Boom was center of clean-up operations. It kept the oil and debris in check until flood conditions caused overflow into the lake. Crews working round the clock were hampered by almost constant rain.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["545665","545661","545652","547498","543760","552814","543105","556506","544460","551947","551262","545657","555866","547254","556939","554544"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["project","machinery","scale","worker","cleanup","bulldozer","rainfall","mud","preparation","terrain"]}
