{"path":"544899.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents a captivating scene set in a rugged canyon. A central figure, a person, is standing at the bottom of a winding pathway that curves through the canyon, emphasizing the scale and isolation of the human presence amidst the natural grandeur. The towering canyon walls are richly textured and tinted in varying shades of red and orange, typical of sedimentary rock formations. These cliffs sharply frame the image, drawing the eye to the winding dirt path and the person standing there.\n\nThe pathway itself is undulating, creating natural terraces and steps that appear to have been shaped by both erosion and possibly some human modification to aid in traversing the steep terrain. Small shrubs and a sparse scattering of greenery are visible, eking out an existence in the arid environment. The lighting in the photograph is bright and direct, suggesting a clear sky out of view, which casts deep shadows into the recesses of the canyon walls, enhancing the textured detail of the geological features.\n\nOverall, this composition masterfully captures the intertwining of human scale and the overwhelming presence of the natural environment, creating a sense of awe and solitude. The person in the image serves as a scale reference and adds a human element to the vastness of the geological landscape.","title":"Traces of iron oxide give reddish hue to this rock formation.","placename":"Bryce Canyon (Utah)","location":"Bryce Canyon, Utah","nn1":["545305","544917","545697","544895","545693","544931","544898","544903","545750","545759","545595","545550","545690","545762","544950","545592"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["canyon","scale","pathway","existence","person","modification","reference","scattering","terrace","awe"]}
