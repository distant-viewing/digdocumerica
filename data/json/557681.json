{"path":"557681.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph captures an elderly man as he tends to a lush garden. The man, appearing focused and intent on his task, is kneeling beside a large patch of white flowers. He has neatly combed gray hair, a short gray beard, and is dressed in a light-colored, short-sleeved button-up shirt. His hands are gently touching the plants, suggesting he is either planting them or caring for them.\n\nThe plants are vibrant, with plentiful white blooms and healthy green foliage, indicating a well-kept garden. The background is softly out of focus, drawing attention to the man and the flowers, but hints at a natural, outdoor setting with muted earthy tones.\n\nThe composition of the image, with its rich colors and focus on the interaction between the man and the garden, evokes a sense of tranquility and the serene pleasure of gardening. The use of natural light enhances the vividness of the plant's colors and sets a gentle, calming mood.","title":"Buz lee transferred his nursery business from gainesville Georgia, 32 miles north to helen, a mountain village of some 270 residents","placename":"Georgia","location":"Georgia","nn1":["550760","544295","544236","550059","544240","549298","551490","551701","554797","546505","546286","551625","551702","548311","551626","551698"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["garden","plant","comb","intent","tend","man","pleasure","gardening","focused","beard"]}
