{"path":"545067.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a quaint, white weathered floating house situated on a water body, reflecting a rustic charm. The structure has a pitched roof with black shingles, and the exterior walls show signs of wear with some peeling paint and visible aging. The house has several windows, with the larger ones framed by yellowish-white trim.\n\nDirectly in front of the house is a wooden dock, adorned with a variety of potted plants and shrubs adding vibrant greenery to the scene. There is also outdoor furniture including a round, wooden picnic table with attached benches and a yellow metal chair, providing a casual seating area. The scene includes a yellow kayak positioned near the stairway leading from the dock to the home, indicating recreational activities.\n\nIn the immediate surroundings, there are additional floating structures and the calm water reflects elements of the scene. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and suggests a lifestyle integrated with the natural waterfront environment.","title":"Washington--Wauna","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548056","548086","545066","547953","544243","544567","547965","545197","554438","548689","542908","545005","548763","547847","550293","543529"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["house","float","kayak","dock","stairway","picnic","pot","shingle","lifestyle","seating"]}
