{"path":"555164.jpg","date":"October 1968","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph presents a striking and dramatic scene primarily dominated by a deep red hue that pervades the image. In the center, a large, fiery sun dips near the horizon, partially obscured by a silhouette of sparse, tall trees. These trees, which appear to be conifers, are mostly barren, suggesting they might be dead or dormant. The setting sun creates a stark contrast between its brilliant, glowing orb and the darkened landscape. The dense, red atmosphere could suggest the presence of smoke or an unusual climatic condition, adding an element of mystery and a somewhat apocalyptic feel to the scene. The entire composition, with its dark silhouettes against the intense red of the sky, delivers a powerful visual impact, evoking feelings of awe and perhaps a hint of foreboding.\n","title":"Douglas firs killed by the effects from fire of an adjacent slash burning in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554139","557629","543410","543400","552337","542680","547719","542679","557588","552896","542678","554396","549811","557957","557591","551956"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["pervade","orb","deliver","dip","sun","silhouette","awe","conifer","darken","mystery"]}
