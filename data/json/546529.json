{"path":"546529.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a wide, weather-worn stone staircase. There are significant signs of wear and some water staining on the stairs, suggesting outdoor exposure to weather elements. The staircase, comprised of numerous broad steps, dominates the foreground of the image, leading upward and slightly curving to the right where it meets a dark-toned building with a triangular roof that is only partially visible.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, four people are visible. They are standing and appear to be engaging in a casual interaction. Their casual attire suggests a non-formal event or a daily routine setting. The individuals seem to be two children and two adults, potentially a family or a group of acquaintances. The children are closer to the left side, while the adults are slightly apart, near the center and right side of the staircase.\n\nThe background beyond the staircase and figures is soft-focused and muted. There are overcast skies and the hint of green foliage at the top, which blurs into the gray sky, suggesting an overcast or rainy day. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is quite everyday and ordinary with a focus on simple architectural and human elements.","title":"Lincoln elementary school","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["556165","551712","546501","553497","545184","551063","558395","558402","552959","545338","552407","547175","552764","551879","553159","551114"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["staircase","stair","adult","child","stain","comprise","weather","top","family","step"]}
