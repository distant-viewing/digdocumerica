{"path":"556857.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a scene involving a train on the tracks, seemingly in a semi-urban or suburban setting. The train consists of several cars with metal siding that have smooth curves typical to mid-20th-century train design. One car, possibly a caboose or a train engine, is painted white with a blue stripe and bears the number \"924.\"\n\nOn and around this train, several activities are taking place. A man in what appears to be a conductor's uniform, complete with a cap, hangs out of the side window of the train, looking in the direction of the camera. Two other individuals are involved in activities around the tracks: one can be seen standing by the tracks near the train, possibly engaged in maintenance or inspection, while the other appears to be boarding or alighting the train, involving some interaction with the steps of the train.\n\nThe setting includes lush green foliage, which suggests the time of year might be summer or spring. There are utility poles and wires visible, contributing to a sense of an inhabited, though not densely urban, landscape. A building, probably a small depot or storage structure, appears in the background, enhancing the train station vibe of the locale.\n\nThe image captures a moment that combines elements of travel, maintenance, and everyday workings of a train line, conveyed with a hint of nostalgia possibly due to the older style of the train and the film quality.","title":"Amtrak passenger train stopped at a station enroute from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to Baltimore, Maryland. The train will continue to Washington, D.C. It was part of the Broadway Limited which traveled from Chicago to Harrisburg, then split into two sections. The other part of the train headed for New York City. In 1974 Amtrak carried 18 million passengers, an increase of 10 percent from the previous year. Revenue was $256.9 million, but there was a deficit of $272.6 million.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556782","556784","556022","556759","557956","556063","556850","557963","556058","557964","557965","556106","556120","555986","556845","556126"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","track","maintenance","depot","conductor","working","nostalgia","inspection","locale","engine"]}
