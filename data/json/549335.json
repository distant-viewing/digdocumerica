{"path":"549335.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a middle-aged man sitting on a large, rough-textured rock. He is wearing a casual outfit consisting of a blue polo shirt and gray trousers. The man has short, slightly tousled dark hair and is wearing glasses with a round frame. He appears thoughtful or contemplative, looking sideways towards the camera with a subtle, introspective expression.\n\nThe background reveals a large, elegant building with classical architectural elements, possibly a historic villa or similar structure. It has multiple stories, stucco walls, and a tiled roof. The colors of the building appear subdued, blending harmoniously with the overcast sky and the soft, diffuse lighting of the scene.\n\nBehind the man and the building, the natural environment and a hint of a distant landscape can be seen, suggesting that the location might be on a hill or elevated area.\n\nOverall, the composition combines natural elements with architectural details, anchored by the human element to convey a serene, reflective moment captured in time. The photo has a depth of field that softly blurs the background, drawing focus to the man and the textures around him.","title":"Dr.  Velimir pravdic, chief of the electro-chemistry laboratory at the rovenj branch of the ruder boskovic institute","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["551347","543503","557078","552113","552871","551269","554460","557035","557112","551346","552104","557034","553418","543713","545770","556563"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["stucco","sideway","tousl","polo","man","anchor","consiste","blur","have","textured"]}
