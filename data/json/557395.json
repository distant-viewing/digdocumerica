{"path":"557395.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene, most likely within a steel mill or foundry at night. The dominant feature is the intense glow of molten metal, casting an orange and red light that adds a dramatic contrast to the otherwise dark and somber environment.\n\nThe composition shows a large metal trough or container holding the molten metal, visible in the foreground, which stretches across the bottom part of the frame. The metal casts vibrant reflections and underscores the high-temperature work environment.\n\nThe surroundings are outlined with heavy industrial machinery and structural elements that suggest an enclosed, robust setting. Shadows and dark colors dominate the scene, punctuated by the warm glow from the molten metal. Visible structures include metal beams, stairs, and platforms, hosting various rough textures and an appearance weathered by heat and labor.\n\nIn the upper left part of the image, a window or an opening with a red interior light can be seen, adding a bit of color contrast to the scene but maintaining the industrial ambiance.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of intense heat and industrial activity, characteristic of manufacturing environments where metals are processed. The image is likely taken during an operation or a pause, devoid of visible human presence, focusing entirely on the mechanical and elemental aspects of the industry.","title":"Operating deck in front of furnace #6 at the Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant. Total fallout from these furnaces dropped from 52,547 tons annually in 1967 to 824 tons in 1975. Powerplant emissions for the same period decreased from 60,705 to 1,825 tons annually. A compliance schedule was reached between the company and the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission. EPA stack sampled plant emissions while developing national new source performance standards. (See fiche #141 to 146)","placename":"Alloy (W.
