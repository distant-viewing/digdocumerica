{"path":"556275.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures two male honor guards in uniform, standing side by side during what appears to be a formal event. Both men are clad in light khaki uniforms complemented by wide white belts, white gloves, and reflective chrome helmets. The uniforms are adorned with shoulder cords and have patches, possibly indicative of rank or unit, on their sleeves.\n\nThe individual on the left is Caucasian and gazes off to his left, while the African American individual on the right looks to his right, each showing a focused and professional demeanor. They are seen next to the red and white stripes of an American flag, suggesting the event's patriotic context.\n\nIn the background, blurred elements hint at an urban setting, possibly a street or public square with some signage and a partial view of a parked vehicle (seen on the right), emphasizing the public nature of the occasion. The overall composition, focused on the two guards with the flag as a backdrop, suggests a theme of service, discipline, and national pride.","title":"Part of the color guard for the bud billiken day parade waiting to step out along the route on dr.
