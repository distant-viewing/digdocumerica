{"path":"546842.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene on a beach that features a collection of dead fish in the foreground, scattered across the stony sand near the edge of a body of water. The beach is composed of small rocks and pebbles rather than fine sand. In the background, the mist or haze slightly obscures the view, but four figures, seemingly children or young adults, can be seen playing or walking along the shoreline. Beyond them, there is a body of water, which appears calm, and towards the horizon stands a misty outline of a bridge or a similar large structure, which is partly shrouded by the atmospheric conditions. The overall ambience of the scene is somewhat melancholic, with overcast skies and a muted color palette dominated by earth tones and the grays of the water and sky.","title":"Dead fish washed ashore at Sandy Point State Park","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["543078","546782","550197","542887","548051","547737","542890","555402","543244","543048","551411","544617","544989","543077","546982","546378"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["sand","beach","pebble","ambience","shroud","fish","collection","mist","haze","gray"]}
