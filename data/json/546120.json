{"path":"546120.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial or possibly post-disaster scene filled with debris and devastation. In the foreground, there are various discarded and broken items scattered around; these include a large overturned drum, pieces of wood, a crushed and discarded yellow barrel, and other small debris. Among these items, there is a prominently torn and partially destroyed arcade machine. The surrounding ground is rough and gritty, covered with gravel, dirt, and bits of rubble.\n\nIn the mid-ground, there are numerous tree trunks that are stark, lifeless, and leafless, suggesting environmental distress or damage, possibly from industrial pollution or a natural disaster. These lifeless trunks vary in size, and many are without branches, standing isolated among the debris.\n\nIn the background, a large bridge can be seen stretching across the scene. The bridge is intact and contrasts with the destruction below, possibly indicating that this area once had better days or is located near a functioning traffic route. The sky is clear and blue, adding a serene backdrop to the otherwise grim foreground.\n\nOverall, the photograph communicates a strong sense of abandonment and decay, possibly highlighting issues of environmental damage or neglect in industrial areas.","title":"Roadside garbage","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["556324","549307","555544","547868","554565","547527","543165","557350","551086","546854","544468","556351","547485","555852","549774","544583"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["damage","debris","trunk","bridge","distress","item","drum","devastation","disaster","rubble"]}
