{"path":"544129.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph features a group of six people at a beach, engaged in activities related to scuba diving. Three of the individuals are equipped with full scuba gear, including wet suits, flippers, masks, and air tanksâ€”two with yellow tanks and one with a red tank. These scuba divers stand prominently in the foreground, appearing to either be preparing for a dive or just finishing one. Their expressions and postures suggest a mix of focus and casual conversation.\n\nIn the background, three younger males, seemingly teenagers or young adults, are watching or interacting with the divers. These onlookers are dressed in swimwear but without any diving equipment. The setting is a calm body of water, likely a lake or a calm sea, as indicated by the gentle ripples on the surface.\n\nThe lighting suggests this scene is captured during the day under natural sunlight, contributing to the overall vibrant and active atmosphere of the photograph. The color palette is rich in blues and greens from the water and the equipment, contrasting against the sandy beach. The focus and composition of the image emphasize the interaction between the divers and the onlookers, capturing a moment of recreational activity and learning.","title":"Navajo boys watch a scuba diving class at lake powell","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544388","543065","549347","543491","554614","549369","555834","552276","549265","548675","555830","548681","557481","553783","554613","548727"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["diver","diving","onlooker","tank","beach","dive","teenager","mask","learning","finish"]}
