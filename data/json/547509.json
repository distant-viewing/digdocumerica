{"path":"547509.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph displays a freshwater pond or swamp ecosystem, rich in aquatic vegetation and surrounded by dark-colored, dense reeds and grasses. There is an abundance of water plants, including algae and visible floating leaves, possibly of water lilies, that cover much of the waterâ€™s surface. The water appears still, suggesting a quiet, perhaps secluded location.\n\nThe color palette mainly consists of deep blues, greens, and browns, reflecting the natural hues of the water and plant life. The lighting is subdued, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the soft light and the shimmer on the water surface, which also features reflective patches hinting at the angle of the sunlight.\n\nNo visible sky or horizon is shown, focusing attention entirely on the close-up view of the water and its vegetation. The image captures a sense of tranquility and the intricate detail of a wetland environment. The photograph might serve as a good illustration of a typical aquatic habitat that supports a variety of life forms, playing a crucial role in the local biodiversity.","title":"\"Algal bloom\" in water near Middletown dump indicates phosphate pollution","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["543561","542554","544593","550785","557498","550786","547639","542582","557445","558009","550783","547532","544541","551352","554623","544765"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["water","shimmer","lily","swamp","illustration","biodiversity","abundance","algae","dark","reed"]}
