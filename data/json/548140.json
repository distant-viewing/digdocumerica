{"path":"548140.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a serene riverside setting with the primary focus on a series of traffic signs. The signs, mounted on a wooden post on the right side of the image, display directions and highway information. The top sign is a shield with \"WEST\" and beneath it a sign reads \"INTERSTATE Oregon 80N.\" Adjacent to these is a round yellow sign showing the number \"30,\" likely indicating a speed limit or another type of route number.\n\nOn the left side of the image, the large river dominates the view, reflecting the clear sky above. The river has a calm surface, suggesting mild weather, and is flanked by lush greenery including shrubs and small trees in the foreground. In the distance, rolling hills partly covered in a patchwork of forests and fields complete the scenic backdrop. The horizon is clear, with no visible construction or high-rise buildings, adding to the peacefulness of the setting. No people are visible in this tranquil scene, which seems to emphasize the intersection of human-made signs with the natural landscape.","title":"Overlooking the Columbia River at Corbett, near the Cascade Locks on the Lewis and Clark Trail","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548031","550660","552108","550656","548144","544262","552076","557996","548096","554566","557106","550624","550613","555575","548098","549457"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["sign","number","shield","limit","patchwork","peacefulness","riverside","information","speed","route"]}
