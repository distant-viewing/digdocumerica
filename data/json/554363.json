{"path":"554363.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of part of a yellow vehicle, possibly a car or van, with a distinctive emblem attached to its body. The emblem is a three-dimensional depiction of the cartoon character Tweety Bird, recognized from the Warner Bros Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. Tweety is portrayed in full color, standing with a somewhat defiant expression and large blue eyes. The character holds a large magnifying glass in its right hand. Underneath the figure, the word \"Tweety\" is stylized in large red letters with black outlines, giving a bold and pronounced effect.\n\nThe background is slightly out of focus, showing what appears to be the reflection of another car's window and structure in the glossy paint of the vehicle displaying the Tweety emblem. The window reflection on the vehicle adds a layer of depth and environmental context to the image, suggesting the vehicle is outdoors, possibly in a parking area or along a street where other vehicles are present. The colors are muted with a slight vintage feel, hinting that the photograph might not be recent, or was taken with film or a filter that gives an aged look.","title":"A car named \"tweety\"","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["545964","547797","554366","554364","547494","557847","557491","545328","557052","553288","551912","542640","555932","545469","552800","549883"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["emblem","vehicle","character","stylize","cartoon","reflection","pronounce","mute","van","depiction"]}
