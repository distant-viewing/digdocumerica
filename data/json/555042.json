{"path":"555042.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense patch of green vegetation, primarily consisting of small-leaved plants that resemble clovers. These plants completely cover the frame, creating a lush green carpet-like texture. In the center of the image, breaking the monotony, there is a larger plant with dark green, broad leaves and a prominent bright pink flower with yellow anthers at the center. Some parts of this central plant show water droplets on the surfaces, suggesting recent rain or morning dew. The overall composition suggests a natural, untouched setting, possibly a wetland or damp forest floor. The lighting appears soft and natural, enhancing the vibrancy of the green and the contrast of the pink blossom.","title":"Oregon oxalis and a trillium in the Queets River valley of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555040","555187","554993","555192","555093","551356","554991","555037","550459","555019","554595","553361","553074","550536","555026","555050"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["plant","monotony","dew","blossom","carpet","droplet","show","vibrancy","rain","wetland"]}
