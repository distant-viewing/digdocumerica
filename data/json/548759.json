{"path":"548759.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph displays a coastal scene featuring a man-made water channel. The channel is lined with large white rocks on both sides, creating an artificial embankment. The water appears calm and reflects the blue, partly cloudy sky.\n\nOn the right side of the channel, there are several static caravans or trailers positioned parallel to each other. These mobile homes are painted in different shades, including cream, yellow, and brown tones, and each has slightly varied designs but all appear to be from the same era, suggesting a cohesive community or a trailer park setup. There are utility poles visible in the background, aligning with the placement of the trailers, indicating the presence of electrical infrastructure.\n\nThe open space around the channel and the trailers seems sparse with very minimal vegetation, indicating a possibly arid or semi-arid region. The ground is predominantly rocky, with similar white rock as seen lining the channel. The overall setting evokes a sense of tranquility and human adaptation to a coastal environment, potentially for residential or recreational use.","title":"Trailer park under construction at Marathon in the Central Florida Keys.
