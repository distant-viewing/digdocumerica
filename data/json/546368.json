{"path":"546368.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a pronounced contrast between socioeconomic conditions. In the foreground, there is a cluster of makeshift housing, constructed from varied materials such as corrugated metal, wooden planks, and other salvaged items. The roofs are patchy and seem cobbled together with available resources, lacking uniformity or formal construction techniques. This shantytown setting shows signs of dense living conditions, with tightly packed structures and limited space. Throughout the area, objects like a ladder, clothes hanging to dry, and sparse vegetation poking out among the shelters hint at the daily life and adaptation of its residents.\n\nIn stark contrast, the background features modern, tall buildings indicative of a business district. Prominently visible among these is a high-rise with the label \"Banco Popular,\" suggesting itâ€™s a bank's headquarters or a significant commercial building. These buildings have a clean, organized, and professional appearance, displaying typical features of urban commercial architecture, including reflective glass facades and structured geometric shapes.\n\nThe contrast between the foreground and the background poignantly illustrates economic disparities within the same urban area. The composition of the photograph, aligning improvised homes with structured skyscrapers, accentuates this divide, offering a visual narrative on urban inequality.","title":"Modern buildings tower over the shanties crowded along the martin pena canal","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"San Juan, Puero Rico","nn1":["546369","546776","549958","549777","552725","552757","549766","549767","549823","556179","553557","557283","549782","557630","549768","549971"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["improvise","salvage","uniformity","adaptation","ladder","pronounce","technique","resident","shelter","district"]}
