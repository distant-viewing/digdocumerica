{"path":"551481.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"In the photograph, we see a bustling street scene captured during a sunny day. The focal point is a young male, who appears to be in his 20s or 30s, sitting on the ground against a large circular planter filled with lush red flowers. He is deeply engrossed in reading a book. The man has curly, dark hair and wears glasses along with casual attire: a dark polo shirt, ripped blue jeans, and dark boots.\n\nBehind him, the background is active with various people walking along the sidewalk, reflecting a vibrant urban environment. There is a group of people including men in business attire and women in casual and business clothing. There is also a child walking closely with what appears to be her family. The people seem to be engaged in their own activities, largely oblivious to the man reading on the sidewalk.\n\nThe setting features modern architecture, with large glass windows and structured columns that suggest a business district or a downtown area of a city. The overall atmosphere is busy yet peaceful, highlighted by the contrasting calmness of the man reading amid the urban hustle. The lighting is harsh, indicative of a bright, sunny day, casting shadows and enriching the colors within the scene.","title":"Reading on Nicollet Mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551434","553222","553218","548609","553187","544960","551831","556775","551829","551970","552751","546478","551642","556776","552749","551793"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["business","sidewalk","30","polo","planter","man","glass","hustle","people","downtown"]}
