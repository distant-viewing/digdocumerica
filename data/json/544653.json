{"path":"544653.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph presents a roadside view featuring a large informational sign at the left foreground. The sign states, \"You are now entering CONSERVATION AREA 3 914 SQUARE MILES of the ORIGINAL EVERGLADES BEING PRESERVED BY CENTRAL & SOUTHERN FLORIDA FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT.\" The sign includes a cartoon-like figure of a cheerful alligator with a measuring tape, adding a playful touch to the serious conservation message.\n\nThe background shows the vast, flat landscape characteristic of the Everglades, with sparse vegetation and water bodies visible. The road alongside the sign is unpaved and extends into the horizon, flanked by short grass and occasional shrubs, reflecting a typical scene in a conservation or rural area. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cloudy day. This setting emphasizes the natural environment that the sign discusses preserving.","title":"Water conservation area of Everglades National Park.
