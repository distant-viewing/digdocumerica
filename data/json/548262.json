{"path":"548262.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a street performance featuring a clarinet player. The musician is central to the image, dressed in a grey suit jacket. He is playing the clarinet passionately, and his facial expression reflects focus and engagement with the music. His slightly disheveled hair adds a casual, carefree vibe to the performance setting.\n\nIn the foreground is a pair of hands, likely belonging to another musician part of the scene, also playing a clarinet. This gives a sense of collaboration or a duo performance. \n\nThe background shows an urban setting with a variety of bystanders watching the performance. There is a mix of men and women, some of whom are sitting on steps and others who are standing. The steps lead up to what appears to be the entrance of a grand building with ornate architecture and large entrance doors, suggesting the performance is taking place in a busy, possibly historic, city area.\n\nThe setting is lively yet intimate, with the audience closely gathered around the musicians, and there is a guitar case open near the foreground, which might typically be used to collect donations. The overall ambiance is one of casual urban life and street music culture. The image has a slightly grainy texture, typical of film photography, which adds a nostalgic feel to the scene.","title":"Union square street musicians","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["557265","557264","551770","558263","553152","553231","553305","558282","553238","553297","553232","558213","551018","551708","557788","545505"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["performance","musician","music","step","entrance","dishevel","collaboration","case","guitar","play"]}
