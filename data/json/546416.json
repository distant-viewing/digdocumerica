{"path":"546416.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This image is an aerial view of a modernist housing development, characterized by several high-rise buildings situated near each other, all in advanced stages of construction. The buildings are primarily in a rectangular shape and consist of numerous identical balconies, lending a repetitive and modular aesthetic to the structure. Some buildings have alternating color panels—yellow, white, and blue—which break the monotony and add some vibrancy to the architectural design.\n\nThe development is situated close to a coastline, as seen in the background where the sea is visibly meeting the shore. The surroundings of the buildings seem sparsely developed, with significant patches of green and open land visible around the area. A few roads can be seen winding through the vicinity, with very few vehicles and virtually no pedestrian activity, which suggests either the newness or possibly the isolation of the development.\n\nIn the foreground, there is prominent construction equipment and partially constructed sections of buildings, including exposed framework and unfinished facades, which highlight the ongoing development process. Overall, the composition provides a perspective on urban development, possibly in a recently developed or expanding area, with distinct architectural uniformity and a scenic backdrop.","title":"New apartment buildings","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546420","556183","544629","553919","553679","555813","555757","555756","547173","557451","553673","553707","543084","555720","553693","548022"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["development","monotony","building","uniformity","construction","housing","vibrancy","balcony","vicinity","coastline"]}
