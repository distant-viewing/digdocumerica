{"path":"546584.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a cityscape during what appears to be either twilight or early evening, evidenced by the subdued lighting and the lights of vehicles in motion. The central focus of the image is the Washington Monument, a tall and slender obelisk that stands prominently against the skyline. This iconic monument is illuminated and forms a striking contrast with the darker surroundings.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a body of water, likely part of the Potomac River, with several boats docked along a pier, reflecting the remaining light and adding a sense of tranquility to the scene. The riverbank and streets adjacent to it are busy with a stream of car headlights, indicating significant vehicular activity.\n\nThe surrounding area includes a variety of architecture, from classical to modern building styles, which suggests a mix of governmental and possibly commercial buildings typical of Washington, D.C. The overall composition of the photograph, with the monument acting as a central axis around which the city seems to radiate, creates a dynamic yet orderly urban scene. The framing and slightly vignetted edges focus the viewer's attention towards the center of the image, enhancing the dramatic impact of the monument and the soft glow of the city lights.","title":"Evening rush hour traffic on the 14th street bridge looking north.
