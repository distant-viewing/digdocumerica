{"path":"557742.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a construction scene in an outdoor environment. At the center of the activity is a large yellow excavator bearing the logo \"KOEH RING,\" engaged in what appears to be excavation or earth-moving work. The excavatorâ€™s arm is extended, a clear sign of ongoing work, with a noticeable muddy trench below. \n\nIn the trench, there are several workers, around six, who appear actively engaged in manual labor. They are equipped with safety helmets in various colors, and some can be seen using shovels to move dirt. The attire of the workers suggests physical exertion, likely related to construction or excavation.\n\nThe setting is a grassy field with trees in the background, indicating that the location might be somewhat rural or on the outskirts of a developed area. The ground around the excavator and trench is muddy and waterlogged, hinting at recent rain or water use that has contributed to the conditions on site.\n\nTo the right, there is another piece of machinery, possibly related to the excavation work, along with a red truck partially visible at the outer edge of the photo. The overall scene is busy and appears fairly organized, typical of a construction or large-scale landscaping project.","title":"Camping debris on privately owned land along poplar stump road spoils the view as a fisherman tries his luck in the chattahoochee river two miles north of robertstown.
