{"path":"552041.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph features an industrial setting with a large factory or plant located next to a calm body of water, possibly a river. In the image, there are several tall structures, including stacks and cylindrical tanks, which are typical features of an industrial facility such as a chemical plant or power station. Some of these stacks are emitting small amounts of vapor or smoke.\n\nThe reflection of the plant is visible in the water, illustrating a still day without much wind. The foreground and the left side of the image show lush, green foliage, suggesting that the area around the water is relatively undeveloped except for the industrial facility. The sky is clear and mostly cloudless, indicating good weather conditions at the time the photo was taken.\n\nThe composition of the photograph balances the natural elements with the industrial, using the reflection in the water for a symmetrical effect, which contrasts the man-made structures with the natural environment around them. The overall atmosphere might evoke themes of environmental impact or the encroachment of industrial development into natural landscapes.","title":"Occasional oil spills on the highly industrialized Buffalo River, which flows through the city, are carried into the Niagara River, causing slicks on the Buffalo waterfront.","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["552210","557392","552194","552040","551576","546118","554630","550996","557377","546005","550956","550995","552179","550694","548070","548195"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["stack","plant","vapor","reflection","encroachment","facility","show","water","chemical","amount"]}
