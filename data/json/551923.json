{"path":"551923.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts two women walking together along a sidewalk, seemingly engaged in a casual stroll or conversation. The woman on the left is wearing a pink top and blue jeans, and she appears to be younger, possibly in her 20s or 30s. She is smiling and has a relaxed posture. Her long hair is styled down, and she is walking with her hands slightly clasped together.\n\nOn her right, the other woman appears to be older, possibly in her 60s or 70s. She is dressed in a floral print dress, which is light colored with dark patterns. Her expression is neutral, and she is looking ahead as they walk. \n\nThe background features an urban environment characterized by a brick building on the right with a scalloped awning and a few parked cars, suggesting this might be a residential or a mixed-use area. The street is lined with trees, and there are other indistinct figures and traffic signs in the distance, further establishing the outdoor city setting. The overall tone of the image is calm, with a focus on the interaction between the two individuals.","title":"Resident of a nearby nursing home, steadied by a young escort, is able to take a walk in the neighborhood.
