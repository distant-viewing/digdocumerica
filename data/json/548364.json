It features a dense array of high-rise buildings primarily composed of office structures, showcasing a range of architectural designs from modern square-edged buildings to older, more ornately detailed constructions.\n\nAt the center of the image, a curved street delineates the flow of the city block, populated with a variety of vehicles including cars, buses, and trucks, indicative of a busy urban setting. This road is flanked by large buildings, creating a canyon-like effect common in metropolitan centers.\n\nOn the bottom left of the photo, there is a rooftop filled with industrial elements such as water storage tanks and ventilation structures, illustrating the functional aspects behind the buildingsâ€™ operations. The colors in the photograph lean towards muted earth tones with the buildings primarily exhibiting shades of grey, beige, and white, likely reflecting the materials common in urban construction such as concrete and steel.\n\nOverall, this image captures the bustling, organized chaos typical of a cityscape, providing a detailed snapshot of urban life from a bird's-eye perspective, emphasizing both architectural styles and the functional layout of city streets and traffic.","title":"Lower Manhattan; entrance to the Holland Tunnel under the Hudson River","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555743","549476","551510","548425","551506","551509","548318","549979","548392","551507","548424","553673","549477","553559","549971","547445"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["city","building","intricacy","delineate","ventilation","construction","chaos","rooftop","street","planning"]}
