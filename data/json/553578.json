{"path":"553578.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a wooded landscape at twilight or during dim light conditions, evoking a mood that could be described as somber or mysterious. The composition is vertically oriented, highlighting the vertical lines formed by tall, slender trees.\n\nForeground: The foreground is dominated by dark, contrasting features, including a series of fallen trees and branches that are strewn across the ground in a haphazard manner, leading the viewer's eyes deeper into the scene. The ground appears rough and uneven, possibly covered in detritus or small foliage, adding to the sense of a natural and undisturbed environment.\n\nMiddle ground and background: The middle ground gradually merges with the background and features thinner trees that become less distinct as they recede into the mist or haze shrouding the area. The light in the background is brighter than in the foreground, providing a sense of depth and mystery. Negative space is used effectively between the trees, giving glimpses of what lies beyond and suggesting an expansive forest.\n\nColor palette: The color tones are quite muted, predominantly in shades of dark blues and purples with lighter purples and hints of white or light gray in the background — adding to the photograph’s overall enigmatic and chilly atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the image captures a feeling of seclusion and the quietude of a forest scene, emphasized by the absence of any human or animal presence and the overall drab color scheme. It could be interpreted as a scene from late autumn or winter given the absence of leaves and the general aura of dormancy.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora scene within the section of the burn area known as \"granite fire.\"  This part of the territory has not yet been logged","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553579","555122","543621","557601","553625","542849","553574","543406","555119","547705","554395","553594","542929","555128","543021","557019"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["purple","absence","ground","detritus","describe","interpret","aura","quietude","become","seclusion"]}
