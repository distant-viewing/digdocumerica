{"path":"553844.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene. In the image, the sun appears as a vivid, bright orange orb, positioned centrally and slightly towards the top. It emits a soft glow that illuminates the sky with shades of orange and red, creating a gradient effect. Beneath the sun, layers of mountains or hills are silhouetted against the sky, their outlines blurred and softened, possibly due to atmospheric conditions like mist or haze. The gradation of colors from dark at the bottom to bright near the sun suggests a depth that emphasizes the vastness of the landscape. This ambiance is typical of a tranquil and isolated natural setting, evoking a sense of peace and expansiveness. The edges of the photo frame are black, focusing the viewer's attention on the central, illuminated parts of the image.","title":"Double air inversion over Los Angeles. (From the Sites exhibition.
