{"path":"558224.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Hanson, Art","caption":"This photograph depicts a man performing on a trombone. The man, possibly in his forties, is wearing a plaid shirt and a patterned tie, complemented by dark trousers and a wristwatch on his left wrist. He wears glasses and is focused intently on playing his instrument. The trombone is brass and shiny, reflecting some light.\n\nThe setting appears to be a rehearsal room or a classroom environment, as indicated by the array of empty beige chairs with chrome frames in the background, which are methodically arranged around him. The room also has music stands, and though they are mostly out of focus, one is visible near the foreground on the left side with some sheet music or notebook visible.\n\nThe lighting in the room is slightly dim, suggesting an indoor setting, possibly under artificial lighting. The focus of the image is quite sharp on the man and the trombone, while the background fades into a softer focus, helping to draw attention to the main subject and his activity.","title":"Band instruction at senior high school in New Ulm Minnesota.
