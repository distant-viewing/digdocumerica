{"path":"552918.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic scene in the night sky that features a striking, sinuous trail of red and white light against a deep blue background. This trail appears to be a bright, possibly fiery trajectory of a rocket or other airborne object, characterized by its jagged, erratic path. The surrounding sky is dotted with numerous stars, enhancing the cosmic feel of the photograph. Notably, there is a small, bright celestial object, potentially a planet or a significantly bright star, visible in the upper right quadrant of the image. The composition gives a strong sense of upward motion and the vast expanse of the night sky, providing the viewer with a feeling of observing a momentous event in space exploration or celestial observation.","title":"Aerial view of stretch of unidentified pollution on Pyramid Lake","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["549109","557611","553067","544119","555838","557603","548215","557579","553024","548912","543002","555714","549623","544123","555843","543008"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["star","night","trail","quadrant","object","observation","exploration","feeling","expanse","path"]}
