{"path":"549870.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts an older-style gas station or repair shop, suggesting a setting from a few decades ago based on the style of signage and decor. The focal point is the open glass doorway leading into the interior. Inside, the walls are painted red and adorned with automotive-related products and promotional signs.\n\nThe right of the frame features a window covered with various decals and signs, prominently displaying advertisements and messages like \"With every oil filter\" and a handwritten sign stating \"CLOSED SUNDAYS Gas Shortage\", indicating a period of fuel shortage, perhaps from the 1970s during the oil crisis era. This detail adds historical context to the scene.\n\nThe left side shows a stand holding multiple cans of STP oil treatment, suggesting the shop specializes or at least prominently features car maintenance products. Above this, a sign offers “Sinclair batteries,” aligning with the era’s common practice of automotive shops selling affiliated brand products.\n\nThe doorway itself is worn, with visible chipping on the threshold, suggesting heavy use and age. The overall ambiance is one of a utilitarian, functional space focused on car maintenance, possibly frequented by a regular base of local customers. The photograph captures a slice of life from a bygone era in American automobile culture.","title":"Signs of the times in yonkers.
