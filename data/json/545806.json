{"path":"545806.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning aerial view of a rugged and textured landscape, likely taken from a significant altitude. The main feature of the image is a series of parallel rock ridges or formations that create a dramatic, corrugated pattern across the terrain. These ridges exhibit a distinct geological formation â€” possibly sedimentary layers that have been uplifted and eroded over geological time scales, presenting themselves as sharply defined, linear structures. The color palette is predominantly dusty browns, tans, and reddish hues, characteristic of arid or desert environments.\n\nIn the background, a vast and hazy horizon stretches out with views of distant mountains under a clear blue sky. These mountain tops show slight shadows suggesting either early morning or late afternoon sunlight. The landscape has little to no vegetation apparent from this vantage point, emphasizing the barren, rocky nature of the environment. The overall composition is a rich tapestry of natural geological formations offering a striking example of Earth's dynamic crust.","title":"Aerial view near Canyonlands National Park showing \"the fins,\" just south of Moab.
