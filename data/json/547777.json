{"path":"547777.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial or salvage yard setting filled with various mechanical parts and equipment. The foreground is dominated by large cylindrical objects, perhaps sections of piping or drilling equipment, arranged in a seemingly haphazard manner. Many of these objects are upright, resembling barrels, while others are strewn around or stacked. One particular object in the foreground has a distinctive look with numerous bolt heads or rivets lining its rim, giving it a toothed appearance. \n\nIn the middle ground, a piece of heavy machinery, possibly an excavator, is partially visible with its elongated arm stretched across the frame. Behind this, a vintage red truck is parked on top of what appears to be a flatbed trailer or similar platform. Parts of machinery and other metal constructs are scattered across the scene, conveying a sense of ongoing activity, although no people are visible in the shot.\n\nThe background includes a line of trees under a cloudy sky, suggesting a rural or semi-rural setting. The environment overall looks busy and slightly cluttered, indicative of a working yard where various parts are either stored or being readied for use or disposal. The light is diffused, likely due to overcast weather, casting soft shadows and contributing to the moody, industrial feel of the photograph.","title":"Oil well drilling equipment in Kilgore","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["556323","547625","548110","542585","547610","547611","554318","554335","547054","548147","546267","547621","550265","556505","556324","554300"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["yard","object","rivet","salvage","bolt","working","flatbed","rim","machinery","excavator"]}
