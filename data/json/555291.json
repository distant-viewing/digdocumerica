{"path":"555291.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image captures a tall metal windmill dominating the foreground, standing sharply against a deep blue sky. Its structure is made of slender metal rods forming a triangular, lattice-like framework that supports a rotating head with multiple wind blades. The blades are motion-blurred, suggesting they are spinning rapidly.\n\nIn the middle ground, below and around the windmill, there are small sheds or storage units, some of which are constructed from wood while others have metal exteriors. The area around the structures shows sparse vegetation and a generally arid ground, indicating a dry, possibly desert-like environment.\n\nThe background extends into a broad, open landscape featuring flat terrain that gently slopes upward into distant hills. The lack of dense vegetation and the wide, open space suggest this could be a rural or semi-desert region. The sky is clear and cloudless, emphasizing the isolation and perhaps the utilitarian purpose of the windmill, likely used for pumping water or another similar task necessary in such remote settings.","title":"Windmill at a home near Albuquerque, New Mexico, is used to pump water for domestic use.
