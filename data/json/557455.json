{"path":"557455.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a suburban development area displaying a mixture of completed and in-progress housing. In the foreground, there is an undeveloped expanse of land, predominantly brownish-red in color, possibly indicating arid soil conditions. The middle ground is dominated by several rows of closely packed, identical white houses with distinct dark roofs. These houses are arranged in a terraced style, ascending the hillside, reflecting a structured and orderly layout typical of suburban housing developments.\n\nIn the background, the terrain becomes hillier and is populated with a mix of larger, apparently more individualized homes that spread out more sparsely up the slopes. These homes suggest a more established section of the community, possibly indicating different phases of development. The vegetation is sparse overall, with small bushes and patches of grass visible, hinting at a dry climate.\n\nOn the road at the bottom of the image, there are two vehicles, a red van and a white sedan, providing a sense of scale and normal suburban activity. The overall ambiance of the photo suggests a quiet residential area under development, possibly in a suburban region in a hilly, possibly semiarid location.","title":"Completed development at Laguna Niguel contrasts with unfinished streets and utilities (not shown). Work here was halted and other developments were restricted following state passage of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November, 1972. State and regional regulatory commissions must present a final report to the legislature by January, 1976, recommending passage of laws affecting future coastal developments.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["548825","553700","553934","553704","553061","544510","544604","557550","544568","557547","544600","548824","544629","553939","553937","557552"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["development","housing","home","phase","house","progress","hillside","sedan","mixture","layout"]}
