{"path":"549476.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a bustling urban cityscape featuring numerous high-rise buildings, streets full of cars, and parking lots. The image captures a dense concentration of modern architecture characterized by varying styles and sizes of buildings. Clearly visible are broad roadways, including a major multi-lane highway that curves through the foreground, partially surrounding a large building which stands closest to the camera.\n\nSeveral clusters of skyscrapers dominate the central part of the photo, suggesting a commercial district. This area has a mix of older and more contemporary buildings. Numerous smaller buildings, possibly residential or small businesses, fill in the gaps between the larger structures, creating a tightly packed urban environment.\n\nThe background extends to a suburban landscape with greener, less densely populated areas. This transition from the urban center to the suburbs is marked by fewer buildings and more visible vegetation. \n\nThe overall composition of the photograph provides a broad perspective on the cityâ€™s layout, highlighting its infrastructure, commercial hubs, and the extensive road networks that facilitate movement throughout the area. This scenic depiction underlines the complexity and vibrancy of an urban setting.","title":"Downtown Buffalo looking east","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["547764","555743","551510","553016","553001","549478","551506","548364","547765","549477","551509","549979","547755","553559","546579","553838"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["building","hubs","gaps","underline","suburb","greener","district","facilitate","vibrancy","depiction"]}
