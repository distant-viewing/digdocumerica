{"path":"547989.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of construction workers in action. The setting is a large building site, where a concrete structure is under development. The photo appears to be taken from a high vantage point looking down onto square and rectangular forms of wooden framework presumably used to mold concrete. These frameworks are intricately arranged in a pattern across the construction floor.\n\nSeveral workers, wearing light-colored safety helmets and loose clothing, are scattered across the site. Each worker is engaged in various activities such as guiding concrete being poured from a large hanging bucket, walking across the planks, or observing the surrounding work, contributing to the energetic atmosphere typical of construction sites.\n\nThe background features what appears to be water along one edge of the construction site, reflecting sunlight. This suggests that the site is possibly adjacent to a body of water or that there is a significant water feature involved in the construction project.\n\nOverall, the photograph illustrates a busy and dynamic environment, focusing on the physical labor and coordinated effort involved in constructing a large concrete structure.","title":"Construction of expo 74 site on the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["553385","553394","547218","543592","556940","543594","553924","544159","549529","546929","544828","547235","556642","555373","546837","547240"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["site","construction","concrete","worker","framework","hanging","pour","coordinate","bucket","project"]}
