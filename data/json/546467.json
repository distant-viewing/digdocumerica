{"path":"546467.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph showcases the interior of a modern church characterized by a striking, geometric architectural design. The focal point of the image is the front wall of the church, designed in the shape of a large triangle subdivided into smaller, symmetrical triangular patterns. These patterns appear to be created by bricks laid in a way that allows light to permeate, creating a luminous and ethereal effect.\n\nThe church's roof consists of wooden beams that follow the triangular motif, accentuating the height and angular design of the building. Beneath the high ceiling, down the center aisle of the church, a carpet extends towards the altar area, leading the eye directly to three figures seen at a distance near the front.\n\nAt the altar, which is minimalistic and matches the modern aesthetic of the building, an illuminated cross stands centrally, drawing focus as a significant religious symbol. The light emitting from this cross provides a central source of illumination, contrasting with the otherwise dimly lit surroundings.\n\nThe atmosphere conveyed through the architectural design and the specific use of light suggests a reflective and serene spiritual space, characterized by its modern and somewhat austere appearance.","title":"First baptist church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["558026","547752","558384","558406","558383","558400","558027","552473","554209","546466","547439","546455","558389","550376","545366","558382"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["church","design","cross","altar","permeate","aisle","motif","carpet","symbol","light"]}
