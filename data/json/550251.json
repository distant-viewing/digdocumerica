{"path":"550251.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of a man working outdoors amid a cluttered, woody landscape. The man is bent over and appears to be drilling or working with a handheld mechanical device; the device directs a stream of air or smoke towards the ground. He is wearing a dark blue button-up shirt, jeans, and brown shoes, and is focused on the task at hand. A mask covers his face, suggesting that the work might involve exposure to dust or potentially harmful particles.\n\nThe surrounding area is strewn with debris, including large logs, broken planks of wood, and scattered fragments that resemble construction or demolition waste. A tire is partially visible, embedded among the wood pieces, adding to the cluttered and chaotic nature of the scene. The ground is uneven and appears muddy, indicative of a rugged outdoor environment.\n\nIn the background, less detailed but perceptible, is a pile of dirt or possibly more debris, and what seems to be an open space leading to a clearer, possibly vegetated area. The setting conveys a sense of rough, manual labor possibly linked to clearing, construction, or environmental cleanup. The image evokes themes of hard work, the physical labor involved in managing or repurposing natural materials, and perhaps a hint of the challenges posed by environmental or industrial work.","title":"Environmental health services worker pumps deadly cyanide gas into rat holes on Lake Erie lagoon.
