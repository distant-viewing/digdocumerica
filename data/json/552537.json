{"path":"552537.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural setting featuring a large traditional barn. The barn, positioned centrally in the image, has a prominent gabled roof covered with shingles showing signs of wear, and its walls are painted a dark color, possibly black or deep brown. To the front and one side of the barn, there is a large, white overhang or extension, which integrates smoothly with the structure's main body.\n\nIn the foreground, a lush green lawn is visible, punctuated by a small, solitary tree with young foliage in the center. Surrounding this small tree are patches of shorter grass and some scattered wildflowers.\n\nThe composition also shows a fenced area adjacent to the barn, suggestive of a farming or livestock enclosure. The fence appears to be of a simple wooden construction.\n\nTo the left of the scene, there are a couple of trees with fuller canopies indicating maturity, and beyond the barn, hints of surrounding foliage suggest a broader landscape of similar rural characteristics. The background extends into a clear sky with ample natural light, suggesting the photo was taken on a day with good weather.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a serene and functional rural environment typically found in farm settings, possibly intended for raising livestock or storing farm supplies. There are no visible people, animal life, or mechanical tools in the image, giving it a quiet and somewhat timeless quality.","title":"Farmhouse","placename":"West Jersey (Ill.)","location":"West Jersey, Illinois","nn1":["550019","549194","557991","552462","556963","555571","554782","555577","543343","547128","542805","556586","555627","554821","547307","547304"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["barn","livestock","farm","maturity","extension","overhang","enclosure","shingle","foliage","characteristic"]}
