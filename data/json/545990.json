{"path":"545990.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene with a significant amount of black smoke emanating from what appears to be a factory or industrial site. The foreground is filled with a vast expanse of tall, golden-hued grass, suggesting a rural or semi-wilderness area. In the distance, multiple large tanks and structures associated with industrial activities can be seen, likely pertaining to manufacturing or processing facilities.\n\nA dense plume of dark smoke rises vigorously into the sky, dominating the central part of the image and contrasting starkly against the otherwise clear blue sky scattered with soft, white clouds. The smoke suggests a fire or an industrial accident of some kind, emitting a large quantity of pollution into the air.\n\nThe horizon is flat, emphasizing the open, expansive setting of the scene. The image captures a moment of environmental impact, highlighting the intersection of industrial activity and natural landscapes. Overall, the composition balances the serene, natural beauty of the sky and grasslands against the harsh, man-made industrial elements and the alarming smoke plume, creating a visually striking and potentially disconcerting scene.","title":"A natural gas installation burns its petro waste marshlands in foreground along the Freeport Sulphur Co. pipeline canal.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["545994","545975","544704","547137","551054","550983","546394","553841","550981","548157","551052","550987","545491","557218","550875","550938"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","plume","accident","quantity","grassland","emanate","kind","intersection","amount","fire"]}
