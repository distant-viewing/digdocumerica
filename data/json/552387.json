{"path":"552387.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a brightly lit, office-like room where several individuals are engaged in various activities, primarily focused on paperwork and discussions. The room is painted in a light yellow color, with a contrastingly white ceiling fitted with fluorescent lighting.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a large map is pinned to the wall along with a smaller photograph depicting a landscape, likely related to the map. Above this map area, there are two clocks, one labeled \"ELAPSED TIME\" and the other displaying Pacific Daylight Time (PDT). This setup suggests that timing is critical to the activities carried out here, perhaps indicating some form of operations or command center.\n\nThere are multiple desks and folding tables arranged in a somewhat scattered manner throughout the room, each populated with paperwork, books, and folders. Various individuals, both men and women, are seen either seated or standing around these tables. Some are engaged in writing or reading, while others are interacting with colleagues or handling telephones, indicative of an office or administrative environment.\n\nAt the right side of the room, more structured and formal activities seem to be taking place. A woman and a man are seen beside a whiteboard with charts and schedules, likely discussing or planning based on the visual aids.\n\nThe general attire of the people in the photo includes business wear, like shirts and ties for men and conservative dresses or blouses for women, pointing to a professional setting. The overall composition of the photograph, along with the presence of technical and administrative elements, suggests that this image was taken in a setting concerned with logistics, planning, or some form of operational management, possibly in a governmental or corporate context.","title":"The Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), is a unique, multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group.
