{"path":"546144.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a scene with three people engaged in an outdoor activity, possibly in a camping or recreational setting. On the left, there is a man wearing a cowboy hat and a light-brown jacket; he is standing next to a vehicle, possibly a small truck or car that has equipment loaded on its roof. He is observing or interacting with the other individuals, and appears to be in a leadership or instructive role.\n\nIn the center, there is another individual, partially obscured, who is wearing a red jacket and is positioned next to the same vehicle. This person seems to be involved in adjusting or holding a piece of equipment, perhaps a firearm or similar object, and is pointing it upwards.\n\nOn the right, there's an older man wearing a dark rain jacket and a hat with ear flaps. He is aiming a handgun with both hands, directly positioned at a target out of the frame. His stance suggests concentration and precise control intended for target shooting.\n\nIn the background, there are trailers that provide a semi-rural, recreational atmosphere, suggesting that this scene might be set in a campsite or a specialized shooting facility. There are trees and what appears to be an overcast sky, indicating cool or damp weather conditions, supported by the attire of the individuals.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a moment of outdoor activity involving shooting, set against a backdrop of a casual, possibly communal living or recreational space. The mid-action poses and expressions convey a sense of focus and engagement in the activity.","title":"Deer hunters at their permanent camp amuse themselves between real kills.
