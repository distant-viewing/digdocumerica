{"path":"547340.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a sunny day at an outdoor gathering, likely a family or community event. In the foreground, a woman sits relaxing in a traditional wooden rocking chair. She's wearing a red shirt, shorts, and matching red socks, with her hair styled in a short, casual cut. Her attention is directed off to the side, seemingly lost in thought or observing something out of the frame.\n\nBehind her, there is more activity. Several people are seated around stretched-out tables that are decorated with tablecloths, enjoying what appears to be a meal or shared conversation. The setting is lush and green, with various trees and shrubs surrounding the area, suggesting it might be a backyard or a similar private outdoor space.\n\nFurther into the background, a white metal bed frame with a mattress stands oddly amidst the party, adding a quaint and possibly humorous element to the scene.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of leisure and community spirit under bright, clear blue skies, with a sense of casual rural or suburban life.","title":"At a saturday auction near hickman, 15 miles south of the capital","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["557779","551004","556532","555947","546209","551017","553065","547741","553498","547756","556522","558096","554489","551682","557672","547870"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["tablecloth","backyard","spirit","lose","sock","community","meal","relax","bed","thought"]}
