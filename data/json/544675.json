{"path":"544675.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a serene and somewhat striking scene characterized by its vibrant colors and industrial elements. In the foreground, a chaotic pile of discarded bricks and cinder blocks is strewn haphazardly, their jagged edges and varied colors ranging from dusty reds to sooty blacks creating a sharp contrast to the smoothness of the water.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by a large body of water that appears reddish-pink, likely due to some type of mineral or chemical presence. This unusual coloration adds a surreal quality to the scene. The water is calm, mirroring the sky above and the structures around it.\n\nA significant feature in this photograph is the presence of a towering electrical transmission tower standing directly in the water. Its reflection, as well as the reflections of numerous utility poles stretching into the distance, can be seen on the water's surface, adding a sense of symmetry and depth. These poles and towers are connected by multiple lines that draw the eye toward the horizon.\n\nFurther enhancing the perspective, a thin line that appears to be a road or a narrow dam extends across the water, receding into the distance beside the line of poles, eventually meeting the horizon beneath a light blue sky. This horizon line marks the separation between the expansive sky and the vividly colored water, imparting a minimalist and open feel to the upper part of the composition.\n\nOverall, the photograph juxtaposes man-made structures with natural elements, highlighted by the unusual color palette, creating an intriguing visual narrative about interaction between human activity and the environment.","title":"Sunset on the leslie salt ponds","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["544695","544673","550753","544690","544686","550684","551519","545167","547890","545988","544699","549555","552256","544692","552154","547581"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pole","water","smoothness","cinder","horizon","line","minimalist","reflection","separation","symmetry"]}
