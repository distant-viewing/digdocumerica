{"path":"545233.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a rural scene with a series of small, shabby structures, suggesting an air of abandonment or disuse. There are at least three buildings visible, all appearing as small wooden cabins or cottages with peaked roofs. The buildings are lined along what appears to be a dirt and gravel path, with tall grass and weeds grown up around them, indicating they have not been maintained for some time.\n\nThe building closest to the viewer is a small structure with an open door, through which you can see it is empty inside. Next to it on its left, another similar building can be seen, also with a peaked roof and wooden walls, partly obscured by the first building. The series continues into the background, with at least one more similarly styled building visible.\n\nThe surrounding environment includes a dense assembly of trees, providing a thick backdrop of greenery behind and around the structures. The overcast lighting and saturation of greens and browns suggest the photo was taken either on a cloudy day or at dusk.\n\nThere are no people or animals visible in the scene, which enhances the feeling of abandonment and quiet decay. The overall composition and elements convey a melancholic and perhaps historical atmosphere.","title":"Abandoned motel and house","placename":"King City (Or.)","location":"King City, Oregon","nn1":["551076","551111","554822","554707","543342","558101","543344","554788","543339","544137","543171","555612","556330","555632","549221","551330"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["abandonment","building","next","melancholic","series","peaked","weed","assembly","closest","disuse"]}
