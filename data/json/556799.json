{"path":"556799.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image features a person standing at a bus stop, predominantly viewed from behind. The individual appears to be a woman based on the hairstyle and clothing. She has curly, shoulder-length hair and is wearing a vertically striped shirt with shades of yellow, orange, and possibly other faded colors along with black pants. She is leaning slightly against a rectangular bus stop sign, which is painted white and has the words \"BUS STOP\" marked vertically in black letters on its side. The sign is also adorned with three horizontal stripes in the colors light blue, orange, and red.\n\nThe scene takes place in a city environment, as indicated by the paved road and the presence of a red car driving by in the background. The street appears moderately busy with a few cars in sight. The backdrop includes a glimpse of urban infrastructure, involving some indistinct buildings and what seems like a vacant lot or a similar urban space.\n\nThe lighting suggests it might be daytime with relatively soft lighting, likely with an overcast sky or shadows from nearby buildings, contributing to the somewhat muted colors throughout the scene. The overall ambiance conveys a typical urban setting with a focus on everyday life and transport. The photograph has a vintage or historical feel, suggested by the style of clothing and the model of the car, which might date the image to a few decades earlier.","title":"Bus stop is a leaning post for a passenger waiting for a Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) bus in Atlanta, Georgia. He is one of 73,727,000 passengers carried by the system in 1974, an increase of 27 percent from 1970. Many of the new riders had not ridden buses before. They were attracted by a fare decrease from 40 to 15 cents, new buses, new routes, night service passenger waiting shelters and fringe parking.","placename":"Atlanta (Ga.)","location":"Atlanta, Georgia","nn1":["546615","556786","556742","556744","556809","549644","548608","551445","546650","547195","557904","556804","549685","556203","546655","556743"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["stop","bus","orange","car","clothing","sight","hairstyle","decade","word","stripe"]}
