{"path":"546436.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene featuring a distinctive blue three-story building front and center, characterized by its Victorian architectural elements including arched windows on the second floor, rectangular ones on the third, and decorative trim. The façade is painted light blue with white detailing around the windows and the cornice.\n\nIn the foreground, the street is occupied by vehicles reflective of a bygone era, suggesting the photo dates back a few decades. A green coupe is parked by the curb, and a white Ford pickup with a camper shell is stopped in the travel lane closest to us. Both vehicles are typical of American auto design from possibly the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nOn the sidewalk, a lone individual (possibly male) stands near the entrance to one of the ground floor businesses. This ground level houses several commercial fronts including signs reading “Center,” \"Lee Insurance,\" and \"Hillman's S&S Co.\" which suggest a mix of local services and businesses.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, indicating a sunny day, which casts sharp shadows and enriches the colors in the scene. Adjacent buildings show similar architectural styles and details and are painted in neutral tones, providing a soft contrast to the vibrant blue of the central building. This setting likely portrays a typical small American town's main street from mid-20th century.","title":"Model block on Washington Street (store front improvements)","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546440","557805","542900","545333","557155","552526","557655","546428","550107","557156","547822","557288","552602","558128","558120","558037"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["business","street","auto","floor","cornice","coupe","camper","blue","shell","front"]}
