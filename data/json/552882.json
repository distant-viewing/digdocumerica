{"path":"552882.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This is an image primarily focused on a single, intricate flower that appears to be a passionflower (Passiflora), known for its radial arrangement of petals, distinctive corona filament, and central structures that vary in color and form. The flower has a pale purple color with white accents and a complex, central part composed of a ring of thin, stick-like filaments surrounding a darker, intricate array of pistils and stamens. These central elements present a star-like pattern creating a significant visual contrast with the rest of the flower.\n\nThe flower is surrounded by a variety of leaves of different shapes and shades, primarily green. These leaves are covered in droplets of water, indicating the presence of rain or dew, contributing to a fresh and moist look of the scene. A few other plant stems and greenery surround the flower, some carrying buds, while one faded and withered flower adjacent to the prominent one adds a natural, dynamic element to the scene, reflecting the lifecycle of the plants.\n\nThe background is dark and blurred, focusing attention on the flower and the immediate foliage. The overall setting and arrangement suggest the photo was taken in a natural environment, possibly early in the morning or after rainfall, capturing the serene and wet atmosphere typically found in such conditions.","title":"Passion flower vine growing in a ditch beside a country road at Tate Cove near Ville Platte","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["555034","543623","555035","547613","551368","554840","544875","550462","554586","553361","545695","545699","545706","557167","550464","545707"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","arrangement","lifecycle","stamen","dew","bud","ring","droplet","star","petal"]}
