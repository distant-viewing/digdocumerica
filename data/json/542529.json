{"path":"542529.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment of an individual engaged in fly fishing within a river. The person, positioned in the lower right quadrant of the image, is dressed in light-colored outdoor attireâ€”gray pants and a white shirt, topped with a broad-brimmed light hat, suitable for sun protection. They are standing knee-deep in the flowing water, appearing focused on the task at hand, their posture poised as they hold a long fishing rod with both hands, the line of which extends towards the water.\n\nThe setting is a vivid representation of wilderness, characterized by a densely vegetated backdrop with a mix of trees and shrubs in various shades of green. The riverbank, visible in the immediate background, features rugged rock formations that rise steeply, adding a dramatic edge to the tranquil scene. The sporadic patches of rocks within and beside the river complement the wild, natural environment.\n\nThe composition emphasizes the contrast between the calm human activity and the rough, untouched natural landscape, highlighting an interaction between man and nature. The overall ambiance of the photograph is peaceful, immersed deeply within the elements of the wild.","title":"California--Kings River","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["554519","542744","550665","554520","552976","550317","542509","550313","553338","555576","550666","543516","553337","550217","543659","553339"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","quadrant","immerse","poise","wild","protection","representation","rock","brim","rod"]}
