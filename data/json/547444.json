{"path":"547444.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a highway view with cars traveling in both directions on a clear day. The highway, clearly marked with U.S. road signs, designates the road numbers 75 and 80, and direction signs pointing toward cities like Lincoln and Omaha, suggesting this is a location in the United States likely near Nebraska.\n\nIn the foreground, the highway curves gently to the right, and the traffic includes various cars from what appears to be the 1970s or 1980s, given the vehicle models and stylesâ€”indicating that the photo might be from around that era. \n\nThe background shows a distant city skyline under a hazy sky, which casts a soft, warm light over the scene. The skyline is punctuated by several mid-rise buildings and one notable tall, tower-like structure, that could potentially be a capitol building or monument, which emphasizes its prominence over the other buildings.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes grassy areas along the sides of the highway, and there is a bridge or overpass visible in the middle distance. The photo is taken from an elevated perspective, perhaps from another road or a high vantage point, which allows a comprehensive overall view of this highway scene and skyline. The overall tone of the photograph is somewhat nostalgic, enhanced by the faded color saturation and the slightly grainy quality typical of film photography from that period.","title":"Approaching Lincoln from the west on Interstate 80","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["555437","549890","547811","545432","545463","544723","557230","546242","546681","542764","553475","553721","556785","542682","553473","557471"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","skyline","direction","road","monument","prominence","overpass","city","saturation","photography"]}
