{"path":"547422.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph centers on a close-up view of a person's lower legs and feet, submerged in a mud-filled terrain. The individual is wearing heavily muddied boots and blue jeans. The boots are dark, possibly black, and have visible laces and buckles, emphasizing their sturdy nature suitable for rugged or wet conditions. The jeans are wet and stained with splashes of mud up to the knee area, suggesting the person has been actively walking through or working in the muddy area.\n\nThe surrounding ground is uneven and thoroughly muddled; large clumps of wet soil mixed with water create a tough, slippery surface. There are patches of standing water reflecting light, indicating either recent rainfall or a naturally wet area like a marsh or wetland. Sparse vegetation, like thin strands of grass, can be seen emerging from the mud, adding a bit of green to the otherwise brown and murky environment.\n\nThe focus and detailed texture of the mud highlight the challenging and likely messy conditions faced by the individual. The composition of the photo, with its narrow depth of field, draws attention primarily to the boots and the immediate ground, suggesting a narrative centered on outdoor work or exploration in challenging conditions.","title":"Feet of farmer John Dolezal slogging through mud on Dolezal's farm near Bee, Nebraska.
