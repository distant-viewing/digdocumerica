{"path":"557374.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene in a slightly dimly lit setting. In the foreground, there are utilitarian industrial buildings with angular roofs and slatted siding, typical of manufacturing or processing facilities. Noteworthy are various cylindrical storage tanks and one prominent dome-like structure reminiscent of a silo or reactor. Some buildings display visible signs or logos such as \"GREIF BROS,\" indicating corporate ownership.\n\nIn the mid-ground, a complex network of overhead power lines stretches across the frame, emphasizing the industrial functionality of the area. The power lines create a lattice of intersecting lines against the sky.\n\nRising prominently behind the facilities are thick plumes of smoke or steam, possibly indicating ongoing industrial processes. These emissions billow upward, dispersing slightly as they blend with the cloudy sky, contributing to a sense of pollution or environmental impact.\n\nThe background is dominated by a large hill or mountain, cloaked in dense foliage, which contrasts starkly with the industrial foreground and suggests a juxtaposition between nature and human activity.\n\nOverall, the composition highlights themes of industry, energy production, and environmental impact, set against a natural backdrop, which may invoke questions about ecological balance and sustainability. The atmosphere is somewhat muted, with a blueish tinge suggesting either early morning, late afternoon, or the impact of industrial emissions on light filtration. There is a sense of quiet activity - no people are visible, yet the area is evidently active.","title":"Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant. Emissions from the metallurgical plant were reduced 97.7 percent between October 1967, and September, 1975. The decrease occurred after agreement on a compliance schedule between Union Carbide and the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stack sampled plant emissions while developing national new source performances standards. (See images 8496-98)","placename":"Alloy (W.
