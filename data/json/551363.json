{"path":"551363.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a small frog navigating a mossy water environment. The foreground and center of the image are dominated by a vibrant green moss, which covers the surface and some submerged parts, possibly rocks or the edge of the water body. The frog appears poised in an action pose, partly submerged, with its head and eyes above the water line and its webbed feet spread out for swimming. Its body is brown with visible textural details such as bumpy skin and limbs articulating its movement.\n\nThe water is dark, creating a stark contrast with the bright green moss and the lighter brown hues of the frog. There are tiny bubbles and possibly small flecks of debris on the surface of the water around the frog, indicating movement. The overall lighting is dim with a focus on the frog, enhancing the details of its body and the surrounding moss. The image captures a moment that feels at once both serene and full of life, demonstrating the frog's adaptation to its aquatic and verdant habitat.","title":"Frog on algae in a pond at Troutdale ranch in gravois mills on the upper arm of the lake of the ozarks","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["551362","549145","557587","557606","555197","555066","544280","555067","550727","546161","554602","542582","547509","542554","544589","550786"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["moss","submerge","fleck","bubble","limb","swimming","adaptation","poise","water","movement"]}
