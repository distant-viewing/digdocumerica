{"path":"555989.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a daylit scene of a man driving a small, red tractor pulling a heavily loaded flatbed trailer. The man, who is wearing a white hat and a white shirt, drives attentively down what appears to be an urban street flanking railroad tracks. He is towing a variety of luggage, bags, and boxes tightly packed and strapped to the trailer. In the background, a prominent feature is a large dark overpass or bridge that stretches across the width of the image, under which the train tracks are visible. This bridge and the clear sky above lend an industrial atmosphere to the scene.\n\nBehind the man on the tractor, a second individual on the trailer can be seen in a casual, reclined posture, one leg extended and resting on the edge of the trailer. This person is dressed in blue and sports a darker hat. \n\nTo the far right of the frame, a third individual in dark clothing is observed standing by the side of the road, possibly watching the tractor pass. The surrounding area looks sunny and bright, with hints of lush foliage in the distance beyond the overpass, which contrasts the stark industrial foreground dominated by the tracks and overpass.","title":"Baggage at Albuquerque, New Mexico, waiting to be loaded on the southwest limited enroute from Los Angeles, California, to Chicago.
