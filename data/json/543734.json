{"path":"543734.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The image appears to be an aerial nighttime shot of a town with various landscape features and human-made structures. At the forefront, there's a grid layout of a town, evident from the organized rows of street lights, defining parallel and perpendicular lines typical of urban planning. The streets are illuminated, and the lights suggest active electricity usage, possibly indicating residential or commercial areas.\n\nAbove this main portion of the town, there are curvy roads or paths that snake through a darker area, which could be a park or wooded region, as the area is visibly less lit compared to the town.\n\nTo the far left, notable features include what appears to be a large excavation or mining area - a brightly lit, somewhat isolated plateau with stark white or light-colored surfaces that contrast strongly with its surroundings. This area's lighting and distinct coloration suggest active industrial or extractive operations, which is further implied by adjacent dirt tracks or access roads.\n\nThe photographâ€™s overall atmosphere, highlighted by the dark background and bright artificial lighting, emphasizes human impact and activity within a natural landscape. The nighttime setting enhances the visibility and impact of the illuminated areas, drawing attention to human occupation and environmental alteration.","title":"Aerial view of Telluride, where the Idarado mill (lead, zinc, gold, and silver processing) is located.
