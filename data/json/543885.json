{"path":"543885.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene by a large body of water, possibly a river or lake. In the foreground, there is a concrete promenade or pier that juts into the water. The edge of the pier features three evenly spaced, robust concrete bollards, each with an embedded circular metal loop, likely used for mooring boats.\n\nOn the pier, two individuals are sitting. They are facing away from the camera towards the water, suggesting a moment of relaxation or conversation. One person is wearing a white robe-like garment and a white hat, while the other is clad in light-colored pants and a gray shirt, also wearing a hat. Between them, there appears to be a red object, possibly a small bag or a container.\n\nThe water itself is calm, with slight ripples, reflecting a moody, overcast sky. In the distance, a few sparse birds can be discerned flying close to the waterâ€™s surface, adding a dynamic natural element to the otherwise tranquil scene. The overall mood is peaceful, with a sense of isolation and introspection conveyed by the vast open water and the solitary figures.","title":"The Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["550245","543951","543465","549471","544266","544306","543601","552291","545936","548537","547595","544283","550835","544260","545911","547217"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["pier","bollard","water","loop","mooring","robe","introspection","garment","hat","relaxation"]}
