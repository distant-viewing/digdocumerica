{"path":"558212.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Stroble, David","caption":"The photograph captures a scene inside a classroom. It focuses on a teacher, standing in front of a blackboard that is partially visible at the back of the shot. The blackboard has minimal chalk markings. The teacher is behind a wooden lectern, positioned slightly off-center in the classroom, engaging with the students or providing instruction.\n\nThe classroom is filled with students seated at desks, facing the teacher. The students' backs are primarily towards the viewer, which provides a perspective of observing the class from the back. Some students appear to be taking notes or looking attentively at the teacher. The students include a mix of males and females, mostly with long hair, indicative of trends possibly from the 1970s or 1980s, given the overall style observed.\n\nThe room is decorated with a couple of posters and signs with motivational or religious texts, visible on the walls and adjacent surfaces. A prominent feature is a cross on the left wall above the blackboard and a poster with the text “Believe in yourselves. We can move mountains.” Additionally, an American flag is displayed in the front right corner.\n\nThe photograph features natural lighting, possibly from a window out of frame, which creates a somber ambiance enhanced by the shadows and the time of day suggested by the quality of light. The perspective is from the back of the classroom, directing focus towards the interaction between the teacher and students during a lesson.","title":"A teacher talks to her students in a classroom at Cathedral Senior High School in New Ulm, Minnesota. The town is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe. Several manufacturing firms have arrived here since 1950 and have helped the town to grow. The business district was revitalized during the 1960's.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558214","544322","544798","548243","554838","558210","543919","548227","546556","543920","552590","543895","546548","554332","558410","553911"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Community Gatherings"],"terms":["student","teacher","classroom","back","poster","text","trend","female","instruction","class"]}
