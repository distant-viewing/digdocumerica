{"path":"554948.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features an elder man partially framed by wooden fences or structures of a barn or rural farm setting. He has a serious or contemplative expression, wearing a light-colored, striped, button-down shirt. To his left, which is on the right side of the photograph, is a cow with a dark head and white markings, partially visible with its head turned slightly towards the man. The cow is fitted with a halter and tethered by a chain connected to its nose ring. The background suggests a rustic and leafless woodland that gives a feel of late autumn or early winter. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is rustic and serene, reflecting a moment of interaction or contemplation between the man and the cow in a farm environment. The lighting is soft and subdued, adding to the quiet mood of the rural scene.","title":"Cow on a farm near Leakey, waiting to be de-horned.
