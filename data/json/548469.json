{"path":"548469.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet striking scene in which a large aircraft flies at a low altitude over a residential area. The plane, apparently a four-engine aircraft, is centered in the upper portion of the frame, set against a backdrop of cloudy skies. Below the aircraft, the foreground is filled with tall grass, which suggests the viewpoint is from another area of vegetation, possibly a marshland.\n\nIn the middle of the image, across a calm body of water, there is a visible community of residential homes. These houses are of traditional architecture, possibly dating back to the mid-20th century, with pitched roofs and various external finishes in light and dark colors. A small boat tethered nearby and a few scattered small boats along the shore reflect the coastal lifestyle of the inhabitants.\n\nThe water body in front of the houses is tranquil, with a clear reflection of the surroundings. The image conveys a peaceful daily life scenario that is starkly contrasted by the prominent presence of the low-flying airplane, hinting at a dynamic between everyday domestic life and the broader, potentially intrusive, influences of technology and transportation. The overall composition of the photograph, blending natural beauty with human habitation and advanced machinery, creates a multidimensional narrative about space, coexistence, and environment.","title":"These Point Shirley homes on Wintrop Shore Drive are in the landing pattern for Logan Airport's runway 27.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548484","548448","548485","548446","544606","548447","550156","553888","550160","544491","548486","556909","548481","551219","542506","542720"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["aircraft","fly","tether","inhabitant","marshland","plane","airplane","house","boat","dynamic"]}
