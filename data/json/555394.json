{"path":"555394.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene likely taken at a large body of water, possibly at low tide given the visible sandbanks. The main features include a vast expanse of water with patches of sand across the foreground, creating intriguing patterns due to the tide pulling away. A boat, relatively small in comparison to the landscape, moves through the water near the center-right of the image, disturbing the water's surface and creating a trail behind it.\n\nThe landscape behind the water is dominated by a lush, densely wooded hill that stretches across the entire background. The hill is covered primarily in green trees, likely coniferous, with some areas slightly lighter in color, suggesting either a change in vegetation or the effect of lighting conditions.\n\nThe sky, visible at the top of the image, is overcast with varying tones of gray and white clouds, hinting at an overcast and possibly cool climate. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is peaceful and somewhat isolated, focusing on the interaction of natural elements like land, water, and vegetation.","title":"Hydro-electric power comes from the Columbia River and other water sources in Oregon. Here the Columbia is shown at Rooster Rock State Park, 18 miles east of Portland, at a record low.
