{"path":"552980.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a surface with a large number of bubbles adhered to it. The bubbles vary in size and appear translucent, with reflective surfaces that hint at their spherical shapes. These bubbles are densely packed, covering almost the entire visible area of the photograph.\n\nThe color tones in this image range from pale yellows and off-whites in the bubbles to rusty browns and dark grays in the underlying and surrounding materials, which might be a mixture of organic and mineral elements. The textures visible range from the smooth and shiny surfaces of the bubbles to the rough, irregular, and possibly moist textures of the earthy material beneath them.\n\nThis detailed capture focuses heavily on the texture and forms created by the bubbles against their backdrop, creating a view that might be associated with natural decay, biological processes, or specific environmental conditions that cause the formation of these bubbles. The overall effect is visually intriguing, emphasizing patterns and textures found in nature.","title":"(From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
