{"path":"547742.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image shows a large number of cars parked closely together, likely at a car dealership or storage lot. The vehicles are compact models, densely arranged to maximize space. The vehicles vary in color, including shades of red, orange, white, and blue, creating a colorful pattern against the controlled uniformity of their placement.\n\nThe cars are of a similar model, giving a sense of repetition and uniformity across the image. Their windshields reflect some light, suggesting either a sunny day or bright lighting conditions in the area. There are no visible people or activities in the photograph, emphasizing the focus on the cars themselves.\n\nThe background of the image is minimal, with faint structures that could be part of other buildings or industrial setups possibly related to the storage or sale of these cars. The overall composition of the image is structured and geometric, with the lines of the cars creating a grid-like pattern, providing both a sense of order and a visually striking array of colors and shapes.","title":"New Mazda cars awaiting shipment at Terminal Island","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["542635","547686","546900","553896","549696","553303","546879","546813","547480","548432","550908","550909","554349","547469","556721","542634"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","uniformity","model","dealership","repetition","maximize","storage","order","windshield","placement"]}
