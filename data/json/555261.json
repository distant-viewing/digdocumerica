{"path":"555261.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a busy scene at a shipping port, which is focused through an industrial framework, possibly a crane or container handler. In the foreground, the framework has visible signs of wear and is painted in a faded yellow color. The geometric shapes and lines of the metal framework dominate the lower part of the view, with hydraulic systems and wheeled supports appearing sturdy and functional.\n\nIn the central and background sections, a large shipping container, painted blue with a stripe pattern, is being lifted or has just been lifted by cargo handling equipment, suggesting ongoing operations of loading or unloading goods. Further in the background, additional similar equipment can be seen in a repetitive pattern, creating a sense of depth and continuity in port operations.\n\nNumerous cranes and other machinery, marked with numbers and company names, fill the landscape, pointing to a well-organized industrial operation. The background includes a glimpse of a ship, indicating that this is a maritime cargo port. A clear sky suggests fair weather conditions, which is typical for such operations.\n\nThe scene is bustling with activity, yet no individual people are clearly distinguishable; instead, the focus is on the machinery and operations of the port. This setting epitomizes the industrial and logistical complexities involved in modern shipping and cargo handling.","title":"Ship at a dock in the port of Newark, New Jersey.
