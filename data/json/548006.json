{"path":"548006.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a recreational scene at a riverbank. The river's water is dark and contrasts sharply with a sandy peninsula where the activities are centered.\n\nOn the sandy beach, several people are enjoying the sunny day, some close to the water's edge and others more inland near the sparse vegetation. The beachgoers are spread out across the area, with some individuals sitting on towels, while others appear to be standing or walking around. Across the sandy area, there are clusters of colorful objects that look like beach towels, coolers, or bags, enhancing the recreational vibe of the scene.\n\nThere are also several boats, varying in sizes and colors, moored along the shoreline, floating gently on the water. The boats are a mix of speedboats and smaller motorboats, primarily white, with accents of darker colors.\n\nThe surrounding area beyond the sand shows a rugged terrain with rocky and green patches, providing a natural, untouched backdrop to the human activity. The top part of the image also shows a constructed embankment, possibly part of a dam or control structure, indicating the managed aspect of the waterway.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a leisurely and pleasant day out by the river, with people engaging in typical beachside activities within a natural yet partially controlled riverside environment.","title":"Part of Crescent Bar Recreational Area at Trinidad, on the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545933","543943","545941","550228","551525","548935","553439","553441","550232","549030","544006","549088","546811","551538","551218","551499"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["towel","cooler","beach","speedboat","beachgoer","peninsula","embankment","motorboat","boat","other"]}
