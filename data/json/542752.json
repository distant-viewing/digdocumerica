{"path":"542752.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking upward view of several towering redwood trees. The composition focuses strongly on the vertical lines of the trunks as they reach skyward. The trunks are thick, enveloping the lower part of the image, and show rich textures from their bark, hinting a deep, rugged surface. Their colors range from darker shades near the bases to more mottled and slightly lighter tones moving upwards.\n\nAbove, the foliage of the trees forms a dense canopy, which filters the light from the sky, creating a beautiful, almost fragmented pattern of light and dark green hues. There are patches of blue sky visible through this canopy, but they are largely obscured by the amount of greenery.\n\nThe perspective of the photo, looking straight up from what one might assume is the base of the trees, gives a stunning illustration of the grandiose height and impressive scale of redwood trees, showcasing their majesty and the serene ambiance of a redwood forest. This kind of photograph is typical of nature photography aimed at highlighting the natural beauty and vertical scale of forested environments.","title":"Sequoia and kings canyon national parks","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543442","543449","554969","542845","554968","553576","542569","542922","543447","554966","548708","554967","554995","553575","542725","557621"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["redwood","trunk","canopy","basis","illustration","majesty","breathtaking","envelo","scale","stunning"]}
