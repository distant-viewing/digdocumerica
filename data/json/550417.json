{"path":"550417.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic and expansive alpine landscape. A serpentine river flows through a valley, creating a striking contrast with the surrounding terrain. The river, tinted with possibly glacial silt, weaves its way through the valley floor, bordered by grassy areas which hint at some vegetative growth despite the harsh conditions.\n\nThe terrain is rugged, with stark mountains that rise sharply on either side of the valley. These mountains are partially covered in snow, indicating either a high altitude or a cold climate, typical of alpine environments. The peaks are jagged and appear formidable against the vast sky, suggesting the remoteness and untouched nature of the landscape.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests that it might be taken either in the late afternoon or early morning, as the angled light casts deep shadows and accentuates the textures of the mountain slopes and valley floor. The overall composition of the photograph, with its sweeping views and natural curves, draws the viewerâ€™s eye along the path of the river and through the mountainous terrain, evoking a sense of wilderness and isolation. There's a notable absence of any human elements or activities, which reinforces the untouched beauty of this natural scene. The color palette is predominantly earthy with shades of gray, brown, and white from the snow, giving the scene a cold, pristine look.","title":"The eastern end of the atigun gorge near the headwaters of the saga-vanirktok river.
