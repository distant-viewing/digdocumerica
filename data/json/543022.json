{"path":"543022.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts three elk in a natural setting. Two of the elk are standing while one is lying down in a grassy field. All three animals are focusing in different directions, suggesting a relaxed but alert state. They are set against a backdrop of dense, leafless shrubs that create a tangled, textural contrast to the soft, smooth appearance of the grass.\n\nThe lighting is dim, indicating that the image may have been taken during twilight hours, which adds a moody, serene atmosphere to the scene. The colors in the photograph are muted, with tones of dark greens and blues predominating, reflecting the low light conditions. The composition highlights the elk as the central subjects, each positioned at different angles, which adds depth and interest to the visual narrative of the scene.","title":"California--Redwood National Park","placename":"Redwood National Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542964","542599","542962","550494","549219","550377","544914","550495","550384","550380","555068","558368","542959","544114","546091","545902"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["hour","twilight","interest","narrative","direction","animal","state","shrub","angle","subject"]}
