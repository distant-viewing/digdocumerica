{"path":"547526.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil, natural scene featuring a river. The river is the central focus, occupying the foreground and stretching diagonally into the background where it narrows and disappears into a densely wooded area. The water appears slightly turbulent, with visible foam and ripples suggesting movement and flow.\n\nIn the foreground, the river is framed by branches that subtly encroach from the sides of the image, covered in dense, small, leafless twigs, indicating that it might be late autumn or winter. These branches partly obscure the view but also add a natural frame to the photograph.\n\nIn the middle of the image, crossing the river, is a concrete structure resembling a small dam or water control feature. Beyond this structure, patches of snow lie on the ground adjacent to the river, confirming the winter season setting. The trees surrounding the river are bare, with no leaves, allowing visibility through the woods to the banks of the river.\n\nThe overall mood of the photo is serene and calm, emphasized by the natural earthy tones and the absence of any human activity or built structures besides the simple concrete feature in the river. The lighting seems natural and diffuse, with no harsh shadows, which softens the scene and adds to the tranquility.","title":"Outfall from a laundry on the pawtuxet river","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["542844","557239","553355","557996","546896","550845","550844","550656","550560","544861","542537","545068","542557","542653","552108","555075"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","winter","confirm","narrow","concrete","encroach","branch","disappear","twig","dam"]}
