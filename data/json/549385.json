{"path":"549385.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph shows the interior of a boat, capturing a busy setting with two adult males engaged in different activities. The dominant figure in the foreground is a shirtless man with a beard, focusing intently on operating or adjusting a mechanical device fitted on a worktop. He appears to be turning a handle or lever, next to which there are various scientific or navigational instruments arranged around him, including bottles, a container with yellow fluid, and some electronic equipment.\n\nIn the background, another male wearing a yellow shirt is seemingly preparing food or handling some items near an oven or storage cabinet. He is partially visible and also appears engaged in his task. The kitchen area is neat, with an assortment of items such as ketchup bottles and drink crates visible, suggesting everyday domestic activities are underway.\n\nThe boat's cabin is compact, fitted with practical furnishings and designed to maximize the efficiency of space. Windows give a glimpse of the outside, possibly indicating that the vessel is in motion or moored. Overall, the scene reflects a blend of personal life and functional operations aboard a ship, indicating a narrative of maritime living or work-focused environment where both domestic tasks and operational duties are performed closely together.","title":"Research laboratory on the vila velebita ii, hydrobiological research ship of the ruder boskovic institute","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["553793","557242","552877","545093","549331","555826","551228","548503","546758","544269","554196","551046","552863","554200","543952","552862"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fit","male","bottle","handle","maximize","lever","outside","furnishing","task","efficiency"]}
