{"path":"542927.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures the stunning silhouette of a large coniferous tree against a vibrant sky, with sunlight peeking through the canopy. The sun, positioned just to the center-left of the tree, creates a starburst effect, highlighting the intricate shapes of the tree's branches and needles. The tree, dominating the frame, is dark and detailed, with its outline and internal branches sharply defined against the lighter sky.\n\nIn the background, the sky gradually transitions from a bright blue at the top to a deeper hue towards the horizon. Below, a calm body of water reflects the sunlight, adding a shimmering texture to the scene. The edge of the land, although less distinct, appears in the lower part of the image, suggesting a high vantage point overlooking the water.\n\nThe composition is primarily vertical, emphasizing the height and grandeur of the tree, and the overall mood conveys a serene and somewhat introspective quality, typical of natural landscapes captured during such tranquil moments.","title":"A magnificent pine grows from the coastal cliffs.","placename":"Crescent City (Calif.)","location":"Crescent City, California","nn1":["543016","543145","543448","548709","548687","553575","554955","551365","548708","557598","555081","554731","554073","547546","555119","549246"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["branch","tree","needle","peek","sunlight","overlook","grandeur","define","vantage","height"]}
