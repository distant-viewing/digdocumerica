{"path":"554149.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment on a golf course during what appears to be the late afternoon or early evening, given the warm, dim lighting and long shadows cast across the scene. The setting is lush with vibrant greenery, featuring a well-maintained golf course that blends smoothly into a landscape dotted with tropical trees, primarily palm trees, which suggest a warm, possibly coastal location.\n\nIn the foreground to the right, two individuals are engaged in the game. One person is in the act of putting, bending over slightly with a putter in hand, focusing intently on the golf ball. The other stands nearby, observing the play, holding what appears to be another golf club. Both are dressed in casual golf attire suitable for a warm climate.\n\nIn the background to the left, another scene unfolds where a golf cart is parked under an umbrella, suggesting a break or a wait for another hole. The background also shows more of the golf course and hints at residential or other structures nestled among the hills and lush foliage in the distance. \n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is peaceful and leisurely, showcasing a typical day of golf in a picturesque setting. The composition of the photograph, with its focus on both the players and the encompassing landscape, highlights the expansive openness and tranquility of the golf course environment.","title":"Golf course built on lava bed near Kailua on the west coast makes good use of land which might not have been suitable for agriculture.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["543633","552608","554148","557512","546959","549069","554167","554492","546513","548821","558098","547286","545249","543262","553980","546509"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["golf","course","club","put","player","ball","hole","encompass","cart","unfold"]}
