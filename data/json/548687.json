{"path":"548687.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a majestic tree viewed from a low angle perspective, giving prominence to its tall and sturdy trunk stretching upwards toward the sky. The trunk is thick and textured, suggesting it is likely a mature, old tree. The tree has a rich canopy of leaves, which appear dark against the light filtering through them, creating a contrast with the bright, slightly overexposed sky visible through gaps in the branches.\n\nThe branches themselves are robust and sprawling, extending outward from the main trunk, creating a network of natural architecture that fills the top half of the image. The foliage is dense, consisting of smaller leaves that cluster around each branch, hinting at a healthy, verdant tree, possibly set in a forest or a secluded natural area. The background suggests a bright, clear day, with hints of other trees and possibly open sky beyond, framing the central tree and emphasizing its dominance in the scene.\n\nOverall, the image's composition focuses on the grandeur and beauty of the tree, invoking a sense of awe and tranquility. The use of natural light and shadow plays effectively to highlight the tree's textures and the intricate details of its leaves and branches.","title":"If you look very hard, and have a good guide to the area, you can find one of the prized mahogany trees for which Key Largo was famous. During the 18th and 19th centuries English cabinet makers used these trees to create fine furniture. The trees are scarcer now, owing to extensive land development.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543448","548708","554995","547634","548709","557621","542958","545278","550792","554967","543488","545292","548686","553576","548685","543442"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["branch","trunk","tree","leave","dominance","prominence","awe","gap","half","grandeur"]}
