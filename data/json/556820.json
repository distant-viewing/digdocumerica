{"path":"556820.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an escalator within a subway or train station, captured from a higher point looking downwards. The scene captures two sets of escalators, one for ascending and one for descending, enclosed in a narrow tunnel-like passage with tiled walls. The walls and floor exhibit a utilitarian, somewhat worn appearance, characterized by gray tiles and metal accents.\n\nA warning sign is visible at the top of the escalator, instructing riders to \"PLEASE GRASP HANDRAILS WHEN RIDING ESCALATOR,\" indicative of typical safety measures in such environments. The lighting is diffuse, casting mild reflections on the metal parts of the escalator and tiles, adding a somewhat stark, industrial feel to the setting.\n\nTwo individuals are present in the frame, both appearing to be descending. One individual is closer to the bottom of the escalator while the other is midway. They are dressed in dark winter coats, suggesting the photograph may have been taken in a cooler season or climate. The people in the image are distant and their features are not clearly discernible, adding a sense of anonymity and universality to the scene.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is somewhat moody and pensive, reflecting the often solitary nature of urban commuting. The choice of a cool color palette and the perspective used amplify feelings of depth and the routine aspect of daily urban travel.","title":"Escalator transports passengers far below the city streets to the Lexington avenue line subway operated by the New York city transit authority.
