{"path":"549570.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a parade scene featuring a vintage red convertible car with two occupants. The car is adorned with small American flags and a sign that reads \"U.S. Senator Bill Proxmire.\" Bill Proxmire, who is seated on the back of the car, is waving to bystanders, and a woman, possibly his wife, is beside him. The vehicle is decorated with more text, notably \"Mr. Julian\" and \"Senator Proxmire,\" and banners across the windscreen. The background shows urban buildings, characteristic of an older downtown area with multi-story buildings that have large, uniform windows and fire escape structures. The day seems to be bright and sunny, casting sharp shadows on the street, highlighting the shiny chrome details of the car and other vehicles visible in the background, including another classic car. This portrayal evokes a cheerful public event, likely captured in mid-motion given the clarity and dynamics seen in the motion of the car and the crisp fluttering of the flags.","title":"Magnificent old touring car carries U.S. Senator William Proxmire and other officials along the route of the annual \"Old Milwaukee Days\" annual parade.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556273","557715","557709","546991","549584","550152","557059","552659","555475","546817","547494","547797","550148","556282","543856","549572"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["car","flag","escape","motion","occupant","parade","banner","dynamic","portrayal","downtown"]}
