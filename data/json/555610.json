{"path":"555610.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This image displays a rugged, barren landscape that seems to depict a mining or industrial excavation site. The area is characterized by exposed earth with a predominance of dark brown and reddish-brown hues, suggesting mineral-rich soil or perhaps a history of industrial activity that has altered the natural terrain.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a sharply eroded edge, which gives a good view of the strata or layers of soil and rock below. On this edge, a small patch of green vegetation is growing, contrasting vividly with the otherwise stark and desolate environment. This foliage appears to be quite dense, perhaps a small shrub or cluster of bushes, clinging to the nutrient-poor soil.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo features a muddy, stagnant pond reflecting the sky, surrounded by an uneven and rough terrain littered with various sized rocks and debris. The presence of water indicates either a natural low point collecting runoff or perhaps a remnant of excavation activities.\n\nRising in the background is what appears to be a hill or mound, extending the span of the horizon within the view and mimicking the rugged landscape in its texture and color. This mound also shows signs of human impact, with its uneven shape possibly indicative of earth moved or excavated.\n\nThe sky above is clear with few clouds, suggesting a dry, possibly arid climate. This also contributes to the harsh and raw feeling conveyed by the landscape. The overall composition of the image reflects a desolate, minimally vegetated environment significantly impacted by human activity, notably devoid of animal life or extensive vegetation, emphasizing a sense of abandonment or ongoing industrial use.","title":"Water lies in a trench created by coal company strip mining off Route #800 near Barnesville, Ohio.","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["552420","554804","545534","544751","545529","552422","554817","549118","555598","549170","552004","552423","550574","544418","549119","554780"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["soil","mound","excavation","stratum","mimic","runoff","earth","excavate","alter","cling"]}
