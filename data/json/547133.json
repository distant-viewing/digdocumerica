{"path":"547133.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a uniquely quirky scene set in a rural or semi-rural landscape. The primary focus is on a small, yellow structure, which is approximately the size of a small shed or large booth. It is painted bright yellow and has been labeled \"SCHOOL BUS STOP\" in black hand-painted letters on multiple sides. The structure appears homemade, crafted with simplicity; it has a door, several windows, and a slightly sloping roof, possibly for weather protection.\n\nInside this bus stop shelter, there are two children visible through the windows. They appear to be peeking out, possibly waiting for a school bus. The expressions on their faces are not clearly visible, but their presence adds a touch of everyday human life and perhaps a bit of anticipation or curiosity to the scene.\n\nThe background features an open field with tall, dry grass, and scattered trees in the distance, indicating a less urbanized environment. The sky is overcast, giving the setting a cool tone and enhancing the starkness of the bright yellow bus stop against the more subdued natural colors around it.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its vivid central object contrasting against a muted, expansive backdrop, evokes a sense of isolation and perhaps the ingenuity of rural living where communities often improvise to suit their needs. The bus stop shelter stands as a bold statement of color and function amidst the vastness of the landscape.","title":"Children playing in rural school bus stop","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["547136","549644","557665","555568","558208","546650","548937","547032","543026","552743","544193","558241","547195","543210","556738","550973"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["bus","school","shelter","statement","anticipation","starkness","booth","stop","need","protection"]}
