{"path":"558215.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Rees, David","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene focused on a group of young students walking between two rows of parked school buses. The setting suggests a school bus parking area or a similar outdoor locality, possibly at the end of a school day or during a school-related event.\n\nThe buses are mostly traditional American school buses, with their characteristic yellow-orange color and large windows. Several of the vehicles have their front doors visible, and they are aligned in neat rows extending into the background where other vehicles and urban structures are visible, including homes with white siding and trees.\n\nThe main focus is on the students, who are casually dressed, typical of a school setting. The students vary in attire, suggesting different personal tastes and possibly different ages. One prominent figure in the center foreground is a young woman with long, straight hair, carrying books and dressed in a white pea coat over a red top with bright pink pants, possibly indicating a trend from the era when the photograph was taken.\n\nThe students are walking in a relaxed manner, chatting and interacting with each other, capturing a candid moment of youthful social interaction and activity. The lighting in the photo is soft but bright, highlighting the faces of some students and creating an inviting and warm atmosphere. This image evokes a sense of everyday school life and the social interactions that are part of it.","title":"Students have just arrived by bus at senior high school at New Ulm, Minnesota.
