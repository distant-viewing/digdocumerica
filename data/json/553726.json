{"path":"553726.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy highway scene, capturing a moment of traffic congestion during what appears to be the late afternoon or early evening, given the low sunlight casting long shadows.\n\nThe composition features multiple lanes of cars, significantly packed, stretching back into the horizon where the highway curves around a hill. The vehicles are diverse, including sedans, station wagons, and pickup trucks, typical of a few decades ago given their design and style.\n\nForegrounded on the right, the highway is bordered by a grass-covered hill, rising steeply beside the road. On the left and in the background, there are utility poles lined up along the road and smaller hills or mounds of earth that hint at possible ongoing road construction or landscape alteration, evidenced further by visible cones and changes in road surface texture.\n\nThe lighting emphasizes the volume of traffic and the glow of headlights begins to stand out as the natural light diminishes, suggesting the time of day is moving towards evening. The overall mood captures a typical rush hour scenario where vehicles are slowly progressing on their respective commutes. The angle and elevation of the photograph offer a comprehensive view over the scene, highlighting the scale of congestion and the typical infrastructure surrounding such a highway.","title":"Morning rush hour traffic on h-1 freeway approaching Honolulu from the west.
