{"path":"554162.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a quaint, small church with a traditional design, set against a natural backdrop. The church building is predominantly dark blue with white trim. There is a steeply pitched gabled roof, the vertex of which is capped with a simple, white, pointed spire or steeple featuring a louvered vent.\n\nThe entrance of the church is framed by a white trim that contrasts strikingly with the dark blue of the walls. Above the double doors, a sign reads, \"KA HALA OLA O KAUMAKAPILI E KOKUA OI HONUA WAI,\" possibly identifying the church or conveying a message related to its mission or community. There is one white-trimmed window visible on the front side of the building to the left of the entrance.\n\nThe structure is elevated slightly, accessible by a modest set of stairs leading up to the double doors. The immediate surroundings are not visible in detail, but the glimpse of lush greenery and wooded hillsides in the background suggests a tranquil, rural setting. The whole scene conveys a sense of peaceful isolation and simplicity.","title":"Church","placename":"Kamuela (Hawaii)","location":"Kamuela, Hawaii","nn1":["554207","558163","556480","558024","554000","558034","558019","547346","554035","554033","554208","557088","554086","552479","547333","546455"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["church","entrance","door","vent","spire","stair","trim","message","set","hillside"]}
