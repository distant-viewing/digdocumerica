{"path":"548635.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a coastal area, possibly intended for industrial or aquacultural use. The image shows large, parallel rectangular ponds or enclosures that are closely aligned next to each other. These enclosures are filled with water, suggesting that they could be used for aquaculture, such as salt pans or fish farming.\n\nThe area surrounding the water enclosures is somewhat barren, with sparse vegetation indicating a relatively arid or saline environment. To the left side, patches of denser greenery can be seen, consisting of low trees or bushes. A paved road or pathway connects the different parts of the facility, enhancing accessibility to each enclosure.\n\nIn the background, towards the middle and right side of the image, the coastline extends into the sea with various small landforms or islands visible. The water is very clear, displaying gradients of blue and green, indicative of shallow waters possibly with seagrass beds or other marine habitats.\n\nA long, straight bridge or causeway spans from the bottom right corner of the image, extending over the water and connecting to the mainland. This lack of built-up urban structures suggests that the location is relatively remote or primarily dedicated to industrial/aquacultural purposes. The overall scene conveys a blend of industrial activity within a natural maritime setting.","title":"Land development at big pine key in the lower Florida keys showing scraping away of land cover and canals dug without sea exits","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548640","548602","550405","544670","545024","548779","552991","550342","552245","548600","544635","544650","548631","544782","548777","552836"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["enclosure","pan","aquaculture","connect","water","accessibility","salt","landform","intend","maritime"]}
