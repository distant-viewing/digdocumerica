{"path":"555414.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures the front of a gas station during the daytime. The image prominently features a large building facade with \"Service is Our Business\" written in large red letters across the top. The station itself has a double-door entrance in the center, constructed mainly of glass panels divided into squares, enabling a view into the interior where some equipment and shelves are faintly visible.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a gas pump that appears to be out of service, with the pump's head and hose clearly visible. Adjacent to the building, positioned on the platform in front of the gas pump, there is a large handwritten sign that reads, \"Sorry NO GAS Hours & Allocation FIRM,\" indicating a shortage of fuel.\n\nThe overall tone of the photo suggests a period of economic or logistical strain, possibly during an energy crisis, highlighted by the apologetic yet firm notice of no gasoline availability. The architecture and style suggest a mid-20th century design, typical of many American service stations of that era.","title":"Gasoline stations such as this one in Lincoln City were closing earlier and staying closed longer, including the weekends during the Oregon gasoline shortage in the fall of 1973. \"No gas\" signs became a common sight.","placename":"Lincoln City (Or.)","location":"Lincoln City, Oregon","nn1":["555416","555413","548047","548171","548168","555415","548169","548176","550103","548173","555506","555489","555467","555452","548053","548170"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["gas","pump","service","station","enable","availability","crisis","shortage","gasoline","notice"]}
