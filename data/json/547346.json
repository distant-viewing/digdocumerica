{"path":"547346.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a scenic view of a small, traditional church set against a dusky sky. The church, which appears to be constructed in a classic style, is white with a steeply pitched roof and a tall, pointed steeple that dominates its architecture. The church has several arched windows, and there is a visible entrance at the front. It stands in stark contrast to the subdued, purple tones of the sky above, which gently transitions into a darker shade near the top of the frame.\n\nThe church is situated in a clearing, surrounded by sparse trees and what looks to be a cultivated field or grassy area in the foreground. The horizon is relatively flat, indicating a plain or open rural landscape. The lighting suggests that the photo was taken during either sunrise or sunset, which casts a warm tone on the church and enhances the serenity of the scene. There is no visible human activity, giving the image a peaceful, almost solemn character. The framing and composition focus on the solitary structure, portraying a sense of isolation and tranquility amidst a vast natural setting.","title":"Immanuel Lutheran Church of Plymouth, typical of many similar old churches of rural Nebraska","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["546455","556480","554207","554035","557088","547343","558034","554033","550287","547333","545366","554208","558019","558024","547439","558018"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["church","steeple","serenity","cultivate","pitch","sunrise","framing","clearing","entrance","character"]}
