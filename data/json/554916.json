{"path":"554916.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures an elderly man holding a young black and white goat in his arms. He appears directly in front of a wooden, weathered door surrounded by the deteriorating and peeling white paint of an old building's exterior. The man is smiling gently and looking directly at the camera, exuding a warm and approachable demeanor. He is dressed in a plaid button-up shirt with prominent colors of yellow and green, which is both functional and seasoned with use.\n\nHis face shows signs of aging, with wrinkles and a tanned complexion that suggest a life of outdoor work. The young goat he holds is predominantly black with distinctive white patches on its face, resembling a mask, and a white underbelly. The goat seems calm and secure in the manâ€™s grasp.\n\nThe background, slightly out of focus, emphasizes the texture of the aged wooden building, providing a rustic and rural feel to the scene. It suggests that the setting may be a farm or a countryside dwelling. The overall composition of the photo, with its focus on the man and the goat against a simple and rugged backdrop, highlights themes of rural life and the bond between humans and animals.","title":"Resident from the area of Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["555531","552938","543690","543029","547326","554195","554948","543849","542795","554950","557369","554951","553064","557938","544391","554949"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["goat","bond","complexion","grasp","wrinkle","man","mask","deteriorate","countryside","aging"]}
