The scene is dominated by deep reds and oranges that fill the sky, creating a dramatic and warm backdrop. On the left side of the image stands a traditional windmill, silhouetted against the colorful sky. Its structure is iconic, with a multi-blade rotor fixed atop a narrow tower.\n\nNext to the windmill, a small barn or outbuilding is also silhouetted, enhancing the rural feel of the photograph. The right side of the image shows a tree, its bare branches adding to the intricate natural patterns against the sky. The composition is balanced with these natural and man-made elements, orchestrating a serene and almost painterly rural scene that evokes a sense of calm and nostalgia. \n\nOverall, the photograph makes use of silhouettes and the natural gradient of the sky to highlight the beauty of the landscape and the ending day. It captures a timeless moment that emphasizes the peaceful coexistence of human-made structures and nature.","title":"Seward County farm and windmill at sunset","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547347","547283","545848","545852","547289","547293","549216","545856","549847","549213","549212","552462","558140","547309","557119","545832"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["windmill","silhouette","rotor","outbuilding","fix","make","nostalgia","coexistence","barn","calm"]}
