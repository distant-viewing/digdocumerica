{"path":"549243.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an extensive outdoor coal mining operation. The scene is viewed from an elevated vantage point, placed behind a dense thicket of green shrubs in the foreground. These shrubs partially frame the mining site below. The mining area itself is a vast, dug-out pit with exposed layers of earth and coal. Visible are stark strata of black coal intermingled with lighter colored soil, emphasizing the depth and scale of the excavation.\n\nA winding dirt road runs diagonally from the foreground into the depths of the mine, mirroring the curvature of the excavated tiers. Along the road and on some parts of the exposed coal layers are small orange cones, possibly indicating operational sections or areas of interest for mining. The background is completed by a gentle horizon of low rolling hills under a clear blue sky, devoid of any vegetation, reflecting a typical landscape of a heavy industrial site. \n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the natural, lush greenery against the stark, manipulated geography of a coal mining operation, highlighting the environmental impact and scale of such activities.","title":"Decker Coal Company strip mine","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["543857","549148","549241","549167","556466","544064","549242","544100","549172","549171","544785","554816","549174","554768","549173","554769"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["coal","mining","shrub","stratum","thicket","geography","tier","layer","curvature","cone"]}
