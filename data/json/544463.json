{"path":"544463.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"The photograph shows a scene of significant destruction, likely the aftermath of a natural disaster such as a tornado or hurricane. The image captures a demolished building with its walls collapsed and roof partially caved in. The structure is surrounded by a widespread array of debris including broken bricks, wooden planks, and shattered glass.\n\nA large pool of stagnant water encompasses much of the foreground, reflecting some of the debris and sky above, suggesting recent heavy rainfall or flooding. In the pool, various objects are partially submerged, including a dislodged door, other building materials, and domestic items.\n\nThe background features a clearer blue sky with scattered clouds, indicating that the weather has cleared since the event that caused the destruction. Trees with full green foliage are visible in the background, suggesting that the photo was taken in a rural or suburban setting during a warm season.\n\nNo people are visible in the image, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the scale of material damage and the probable impact on human lives associated with this scene. The general atmosphere is one of quiet desolation and loss.","title":"Part of widespread damage caused by flooding of Guadalupe River","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["544464","544467","547079","544797","557993","547888","555540","544583","544458","547130","547868","544468","550260","553556","544461","557350"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["destruction","pool","loss","flooding","disaster","debris","material","rainfall","aftermath","desolation"]}
