{"path":"554019.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image depicts an aerial view of a coastline and bay area. The bay is relatively large, with dark blue waters enclosed partly by a curved spit of land that juts into the water, making a semi-circular shape. The landscape surrounding the bay consists of hilly terrain, varying in color from deep browns to lush greens, indicating a variety of vegetation.\n\nAlong the coastline, there are patches of development, including several buildings which could be residences, with some areas having dense tree coverage which suggests a tropical or subtropical setting. On the bay's shores, there are docks visible, and several boats are stationed near the shoreline, likely for fishing or recreation.\n\nThe surrounding hills have areas that appear barren or less vegetated, possibly due to agricultural use or natural aridity. The spit of land enclosing the bay features a constructed barrier, potentially for protecting the inner bay and controlling water flow. The overall setting suggests a peaceful, natural environment possibly used for both living and leisure activities with an emphasis on enjoying the waterfront.","title":"Aerial view of abandoned fish pond. In the days of the kings people were forbidden to eat fish from the ocean when they were breeding, so fish were stored in ponds. The ponds are part of Hawaii's ancient culture and native islanders fear that developers will obliterate them all. The ponds are more in evidence on Molokai than on any other island.","placename":"Molokai (Hawaii)","location":"Molokai, Hawaii","nn1":["547637","554143","554020","548779","554022","554171","547984","545128","550640","548638","548604","547636","556966","550363","548785","552922"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["bay","residence","coverage","land","recreation","living","emphasis","coastline","barrier","waterfront"]}
