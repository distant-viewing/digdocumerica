{"path":"548898.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of agricultural activities across a broad expanse of farmland. The composition is dominated by large, rectangular fields, each showing different stages of cultivation or types of crops. There are fields with rich green crops, while others appear to be freshly plowed, revealing dark brown soil.\n\nA remarkable feature of this image is the presence of three tractors in the lower center, moving parallel to each other. They are kicking up clouds of dust as they work, which suggests that they might be involved in plowing, planting, or perhaps spreading fertilizer or pesticide. The plumes of dust created by the tractors add a dynamic element to the scene, indicating active and ongoing farming operations.\n\nThe landscape is primarily flat, and the fields are segmented by narrow paths or small access roads that separate one field from another. The colors in the image, varying from shades of browns to vibrant greens, along with the geometric precision of the farmlands, offer a detailed glimpse into the structured and repetitive nature of agricultural land use.\n\nNo buildings, vehicles, or people are visible other than the tractors at work, focusing attention solely on the agricultural practices being carried out. The overall image gives an impression of productivity and the extensive human effort involved in agriculture.","title":"Fertilizing fields","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548902","548820","548903","548907","549104","547297","553048","545893","554202","548991","548908","552858","544548","544552","557517","558414"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["tractor","farmland","field","dust","crop","pesticide","productivity","planting","precision","cultivation"]}
