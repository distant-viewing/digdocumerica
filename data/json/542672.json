{"path":"542672.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image captures an aerial view from a plane, looking down over a vast urban area. On the right side of the frame, you can see the front section of an aircraft engine, labeled \"TURBO SYSTEM\" on its casing, which suggests that this photograph was taken from inside the aircraft through a window. The engine's smooth, cylindrical shape is a stark contrast to the densely packed cityscape below.\n\nThe landscape below is a dense tapestry of buildings, roads, and likely other urban infrastructure, sprawling out into the distance where the city fades into a hazy horizon. There are clusters of taller buildings which could be a downtown or central business district. The arrangement and density of the buildings give a sense of a large, populous city. The roadways are visible as more organized lines amidst the chaos of structural development.\n\nThe color palette outside the aircraft features shades of blues and grays, suggesting either early morning light or a slightly overcast sky. The light casts soft shadows and contributes to a slight bluish hue in the distance, possibly due to atmospheric scattering or air pollution. The horizon line is quite indistinct, blending the city into the sky and mountains in the background, which adds to the sense of vastness and urban sprawl. The overall composition juxtaposes the machinery of human flight with the sprawling product of human settlement.","title":"Plane monitors smog over Los Angeles","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["542673","544073","547765","547755","547764","553001","555762","555755","552394","552233","549979","551505","555743","553559","553728","553016"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["aircraft","engine","city","sprawl","scattering","chaos","tapestry","plane","downtown","district"]}
