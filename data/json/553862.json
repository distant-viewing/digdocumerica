{"path":"553862.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of the Statue of Liberty located on Liberty Island in the harbor of New York City. The image is captured during the day with soft lighting, likely during either early morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the long shadows and warm tone of the sunlight.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty is positioned prominently in the center of the image, surrounded by water. The statue faces towards the northeast, with its right arm holding aloft a torch. The statue is set on a large pedestal, which features a classical design with multiple tiered levels. Surrounding the statue and its base is a star-shaped structure with green space visible around the edges.\n\nThe waters around Liberty Island show ripples and gentle waves, reflecting the sunlight and creating patterns on the surface. The composition also includes a wider view of the harbor area, where several boats and ships can be seen, along with distant land masses that frame the background.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of peacefulness and isolation of the statue within its maritime setting, highlighted by the vast expanses of water and the distant cityscape. The aerial perspective provides a comprehensive view of the arrangement of the island and the surrounding harbor, emphasizing the iconic status and solitary grandeur of the Statue of Liberty.","title":"Oil slick surrounds the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor (from the SITES exhibition.
