{"path":"548101.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This image captures a maritime scene featuring a large green truss bridge spanning across a body of water under an overcast sky. Positioned prominently in the foreground are three ships: the leftmost ship is a darker vessel with numerous rust spots and the middle ship, notably larger and more modern, boasts a reddish hull with white superstructure. A third, smaller ship is visible behind the second ship, partially obscuring its view.\n\nThe bridge, with its distinctive geometric truss design, stretches across the top portion of the frame, effectively connecting two landmasses that are not visible in the photograph. Its green color contrasts with the grey-blue tones of the water and sky.\n\nIn the background behind the ships and under the bridge, there are glimpses of distant hills or landforms, somewhat shrouded by the atmospheric conditions. The overall tone of the sky suggests either early morning or late afternoon light, contributing to the serene yet industrious ambience of the scene. There are also faint outlines of tall structures, possibly antennae, slightly visible in the distance, suggesting proximity to a facility or industrial area.","title":"Cargo ships and bridge at Longview, home of the weyerhauser company, one of the world's largest forest operations","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["547064","547061","550955","550954","550965","548375","555799","548071","546724","550964","552247","550189","549068","548207","552262","546870"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","truss","bridge","antennae","boast","superstructure","landmass","landform","ambience","shroud"]}
