{"path":"543833.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a scene set in a vast, open landscape. In the foreground, there is a man standing on what appears to be a field with sparse, low vegetation. He is dressed in a manner that suggests he might be engaged in outdoor or agricultural work. His attire includes a light-colored, long-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and boots. He also dons a weathered cowboy hat and has a shovel over his shoulder, further supporting the impression of working outdoors. The man is positioned slightly to the right of the frame, standing in profile with his left hand on his hip and looking towards the horizon.\n\nIn the background, majestic snow-capped mountains dominate the horizon, conveying a serene and rugged landscape. The sky is clear and brightly lit, suggesting it might be midday. The mountains' white peaks contrast dramatically with the blue sky and the earthy tones of the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph suggests themes of solitude, the grandeur of nature, and perhaps the contemplativeness that can accompany outdoor labor. The positioning of the man, looking out towards the mountains, might imply a moment of rest or reflection amidst his work. The natural light and expansive setting contribute to a sense of freedom and the vastness of the natural environment.","title":"Worker irrigates land with water from San Miguel River.","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["553801","554500","542548","545753","553093","544857","544874","549083","545592","543720","543763","544905","552676","545755","543376","550421"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["mountain","work","hip","don","freedom","shovel","cowboy","positioning","accompany","midday"]}
