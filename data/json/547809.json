{"path":"547809.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a silhouette of a person wearing a wide-brimmed hat, likely shot through a vehicle window. The image is largely occupied by the shadowed silhouette, giving it an almost graphic quality. The backdrop features a distressed painted wall advertisement, with reversed text that reads \"WELCOME CAFE,\" \"HOT TISH TO GO,\" and \"MEXICAN FOOD,\" suggestive of a roadside diner. The scene is framed within architectural features, including arches that add a sense of location, likely southwestern or of Spanish influence. The natural lighting enhances the outlines and shapes, creating a striking contrast between light and shadow, emphasizing the silhouette and the text. The resulting composition uses negative space and urban elements to convey a mood of transient stillness and quiet anticipation.","title":"Customer's shadow reflected in window of New Market Cafe in the Old Mexican Market area","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["544092","543039","545323","542802","555930","547820","545349","555140","548072","554421","553223","557277","547821","543028","544437","553226"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["silhouette","text","diner","cafe","anticipation","influence","roadside","arch","advertisement","food"]}
