{"path":"542720.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a commercial airliner, likely a four-engine jet, in mid-flight against a clear sky. The aircraft is captured from a front-bottom angle, emphasizing its landing gear, which appears to be partially deployed, suggesting that it is either taking off or preparing to land. The underside of the plane shows detail, including various hatches, panels, and the physical structure of the aircraft.\n\nThe plane is prominently featured in the center of the image, against a plain, slightly grainy, blue sky background, which provides a stark contrast that highlights the aircraft. The nose of the airplane is oriented slightly downwards, and visible lights are turned on—both at the front gear and under the wings—enhancing visibility and safety features. The wings, extended horizontally, bear the aircraft's weight and the engines, which look powerful and sturdy.\n\nThe photograph's quality gives it a slightly vintage feel, perhaps indicating that it was taken some years ago. The framing and composition focus primarily on the technical attributes and dynamics of the aircraft during flight, capturing a moment of human engineering in action. The overall mood conveyed is one of power and forward movement, typical of aviation-related imagery.","title":"Jet landing","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["547810","542670","542719","547824","549621","544606","544491","553731","545935","548448","548485","542717","542718","542496","548469","548447"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["aircraft","plane","wing","gear","hatch","deploy","attribute","underside","aviation","imagery"]}
