The helmet is white with a black visor and a red font, and the letters are prominently displayed across the front. The officer's eyes are visible under the visor, and his expression appears focused. The background behind him is dark, emphasizing his face and the helmet. The frame focuses tight on his head and top of his shoulders, making the helmet a clear focal point against the darker surroundings, and his facial features slightly shadowy, adding to the seriousness of his expression.","title":"A member of the force","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["546659","546028","551918","556343","553610","554953","556867","546041","556599","555264","553634","554043","558312","544128","556428","546675"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["helmet","officer","eyes","seriousness","font","police","shoulders","portrait","expression","word"]}
