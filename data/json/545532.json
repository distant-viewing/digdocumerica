{"path":"545532.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant industrial scene focusing on the operation of molten metal processing. It prominently features a large, tilted furnace from which a fiery stream of molten metal is being poured. The furnace, glowing intensely with yellow and orange hues, casts a brilliant light that illuminates the surrounding darkness.\n\nThe metal flows in a dramatic, sparkling cascade, creating an arc of shining droplets and sprays as it descends towards what appears to be a containment or mold area below, set slightly to the right in the frame. The base area is less illuminated, emphasizing the bright, dynamic flow of the metal.\n\nThe background is mostly shrouded in darkness, focusing all visual attention on the molten metal and the operation of the furnace. There are no visible people or other objects in the immediate vicinity, highlighting the industrial machinery and the elemental process of metal work. The overall atmosphere is one of intense heat and industrial vigor.","title":"Detail of steel making process inside u.s.  Steel plant.  Blast furnaces are being discontinued at u.s.
