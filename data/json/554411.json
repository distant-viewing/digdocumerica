{"path":"554411.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural, wooded scene involving a log chopping activity. In the foreground, numerous freshly cut tree logs are scattered across the ground amidst wood chips and debris, suggesting recent logging or wood chopping. Some logs are cut cleanly, arranged in a staggered pattern, while others are still intact but downed.\n\nA person is visible in the image, in motion, captured walking towards the right side of the frame. This individual is dressed in typical outdoor workwear: blue jeans, a dark jacket, and a bright red or orange cap, indicating practical attire for outdoor, labor-intensive tasks.\n\nIn the background, an older, small white house with a porch is partially visible, adding a homely, rustic element to the scene. Adjacent to the home, a vintage truck, laden with chopped logs, is parked. The truck is old-fashioned, with a rounded body typical of mid-20th-century vehicle design.\n\nThe environment is densely wooded with leafless trees, suggesting the season might be late autumn or winter. The overall atmosphere is one of rural life and the utilitarian task of wood gathering, possibly for heating purposes, which is underscored by the natural, somewhat overcast lighting and bare trees, giving the scene a somber yet industrious quality.","title":"Woodsman at Big Moose unloading hardwood logs (mostly beech) to be sawed and split for firewood.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554412","555472","543588","545060","554416","558315","554413","552583","542773","542770","542623","553601","553612","554419","542771","555470"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","chop","wood","workwear","cut","down","heating","truck","task","chip"]}
