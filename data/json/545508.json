{"path":"545508.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts a person in a natural, forest setting attaching a note to a tree. The individual, likely female based on appearance, is wearing a white shirt and a colorful purple and blue hat. With one hand, she pins a green note with written text to the tree using a hammer, while the other hand holds the nail. \n\nThe setting around her is lush and green with dense trees, indicating that it might be a wet or misty day, given the general moist appearance of the environment. In the background, slightly blurred, is a yellow Volkswagen Beetle parked on a muddy path. This scene likely portrays an individual engaged in some form of outdoor communication or message-leaving, possibly for an event or as a directional guide in what appears to be a relatively secluded forest area.","title":"Member of weekend trip to Bankhead National Forest organized by GASP (Greater Alliance to Stop Pollution) to point up the campaign to prevent clear-cutting here.
