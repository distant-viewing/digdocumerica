{"path":"549006.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a rural scene that predominantly features a vintage red and blue U.S. mailbox in the foreground. The mailbox is marked with bold white letters: \"LETTERS\" on the top segment and \"U.S. MAIL\" on the lower segment. It also displays a tag with the collection times, adding a touch of realism and functionality to the scene.\n\nIn the background, there is a small, faded building with what appears to be a metal sheet roof and light-colored walls. Adjacent to this structure is a larger trailer-like unit painted in silver, possibly a storage or utility trailer. The surrounding area is open and dusty with hints of grass and small bushes scattered around, suggesting a somewhat arid environment. There is a dirt path or road leading toward the buildings. The sky is clear and blue, indicating a sunny day.\n\nThe setting seems to be a functional, utilitarian space possibly on a farm or similar rural setting, given the presence of large stones and a basic trash can adjacent to the structures. The scene is quiet and devoid of people, emphasizing the tranquility and isolation typical of rural landscapes. The focus on the mailbox, a symbol of communication, contrasts with the isolated feel of the surroundings, invoking a sense of connection in a remote setting.","title":"Post office at alamo","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549005","557760","556984","542702","557759","547290","552468","557566","556370","554132","550991","547296","549196","557950","547658","557567"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["mailbox","trailer","segment","letter","realism","tag","sheet","invoke","communication","silver"]}
