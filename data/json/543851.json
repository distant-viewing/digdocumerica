{"path":"543851.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This is a close-up photograph of a young deer, likely a fawn, set amidst a natural environment. The deer is facing slightly towards the viewer, and the focus is sharp on its large, expressive ears and eyes. The texture of the fawn's fur is visible, showing a patterned speckle of light and dark brown, which helps in camouflage. Its ears are perked up, indicating alertness, with the inner ear details distinctly prominent.\n\nThe background and immediate surroundings of the fawn are softly out of focus, suggesting a natural, wild habitat. The colors in the background blend into a mix of earthy browns and muted greens, likely indicating brush or forest foliage. There are also hints of dried leaves or similar flora in the foreground, adding to the rustic and autumnal feel of the setting.\n\nThis portrayal captures a tender and intimate moment in nature, highlighting the delicate and vigilant nature of a young wildlife inhabitant in its natural habitat.","title":"Two-week-old fawn was orphaned when its mother was hit by an autoMobile. It is being bottle-fed by workers at the Balarat Nature Center in the Rocky Mountain foothills. The center is on a 700-acre plot, owned by the Denver Public School system, and used for ecological studies.","placename":"Boulder (Colo.)","location":"Boulder, Colorado","nn1":["543839","550803","550802","544916","550804","543279","546163","546159","554621","544434","552339","542778","545902","558368","543369","543847"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["ear","deer","habitat","alertness","inhabitant","camouflage","brush","speckle","fur","portrayal"]}
