{"path":"549772.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive outdoor scene characterized by a multitude of birds in flight against a vast, dynamic sky. The sky is a vivid blue scattered with soft, wispy clouds that stretch across the frame, morphing into deeper shades towards the upper portion. It dominates the upper two-thirds of the image.\n\nFilling this expansive sky are many birds, likely seagulls, engaged in flight. Their presence is dense and occupies a major part of the sky, suggesting either migration or a collective movement towards or away from a source of interest. The birds near the bottom are distinguished by their bright underbellies, catching the sun's light, while those higher up become mere silhouettes against the blue sky.\n\nThe bottom third of the image reveals a barren, undulating hillside that slopes gently from the left to the right of the frame. The landscape is rocky and sparse, covered in what appears to be scrappy vegetation or low bushes, providing a stark, natural contrast to the sky above. The land and sky are divided by the horizon line that runs across the image, serving as a grounding visual element amidst the flurry of activity in the air.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph balances the earthy tones of the rugged terrain with the airy, light tones of the sky, creating a dynamic interaction between the grounded landscape and the freedom of the sky-bound birds. The predominant theme could be interpreted as one of natural beauty and the instinctual patterns of wildlife.","title":"City dump in the Bronx area attracts thousands of scavenging gulls","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553875","544609","552238","557123","557208","544605","544834","550888","549757","557125","550887","550382","553347","557203","554646","557202"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","third","flight","sky","bind","interpret","seagull","freedom","multitude","distinguish"]}
