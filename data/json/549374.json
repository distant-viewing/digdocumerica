{"path":"549374.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene. It features a solitary boat stationed on what appears to be a calm body of water, possibly a sea or lake. The boat, possibly a small fishing vessel or leisure craft, is equipped with a cabin and typical maritime gear including poles, possibly for navigation or fishing.\n\nThe shot is framed creatively through a natural vignette formed by overhanging foliage, likely branches and leaves of nearby trees, which are out of focus. This framing technique lends an element of intimacy and seclusion to the image, as if the viewer is secretly observing this peaceful moment from a hidden spot behind the leaves.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the picture is quite moody, emphasized by the dim lighting and the choice of a cool blue palette, suggesting that this could be an image taken around twilight. The water's surface gently reflects the dim light, enhancing the tranquil and slightly mysterious quality of the scene.","title":"The Ruder Boskovic Institute's research ship on the Adriatic Sea.
