{"path":"547811.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban highway during what appears to be daytime. The highway is multi-lane, heading in both directions, with numerous cars of various models and colors occupying the lanes. Most vehicles seem to be from the 1970s or 1980s, suggesting this photo might be from around that time period.\n\nThe foreground shows a closer view of the highway travel lanes in one direction, with cars heading towards the camera. The asphalt lane is bordered by a shoulder and guardrails, beyond which the opposite side of the highway can be seen with more vehicles traveling in the other direction. \n\nRunning along the highway are street lamps and electrical poles placed at regular intervals. The road’s horizon line merges under a slightly cloudy sky with hints of blue and a few fluffy clouds, and distant buildings or infrastructure can vaguely be seen. Also noticeable in the background, to the right of the image, is a large sign with partially visible text, possibly an advertisement or informational sign.\n\nOverall, it’s a dynamic scene that gives a sense of everyday traffic in a developed, possibly suburban area.","title":"Traffic from Central Expressway near Gemini Drive","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["555437","549890","542764","556785","546681","556194","557230","546686","547569","546612","547785","553727","547780","545455","547823","545463"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","lane","direction","interval","guardrail","asphalt","advertisement","travel","car","lamp"]}
