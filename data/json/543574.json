{"path":"543574.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial water treatment plant surrounded by a forested area. The facility includes several large water treatment tanks; two of them are circular with central bridges supporting radial scrapers used to clear sediments from the water surface. These tanks appear to be primary or secondary clarifiers based on their design and the center-mounted equipment.\n\nIn the center-left part of the photo are additional water treatment structures and a building with several tanks and an extended canopy, likely used for further processing steps such as filtration or chemical treatment. A gravel pathway, possibly for maintenance access, branches around the tanks and buildings.\n\nThe background consists primarily of tall coniferous trees that suggest the plant is located in a region with a significant forest coverage. A curved paved road can also be seen bordering one side of the plant, enhancing accessibility to the site.\n\nThe notable absence of people and moving vehicles gives the scene a static and calm appearance, focusing entirely on the infrastructure of the water treatment process. The overall composition and elements in the photograph illustrate a typical setup for a municipal or industrial water treatment facility, emphasizing functionality and integration with the natural surroundings.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543573","548212","548151","543572","543571","544555","545840","549636","548137","547262","548216","547239","546895","549635","547260","547568"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["treatment","tank","plant","water","accessibility","integration","coverage","facility","forest","functionality"]}
