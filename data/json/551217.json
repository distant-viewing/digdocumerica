{"path":"551217.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph presents a serene river scene embraced by thick greenery. From a high vantage point, the image captures a broad, winding river flowing through a forested landscape. Lush, dense trees predominantly occupy the foreground and the slope descending to the riverbank, exhibiting varying shades of green.\n\nOn the river, the focus is split between a few small boats. One boat, noticeably creating a white wake trail, moves briskly on the water, suggesting a leisure or travel activity. Two more boats can be seen in the distance near what appears to be a small docking area or a riverside establishment, potentially indicating a local hub for boating activity.\n\nThe topography suggests a secluded, possibly recreational area, ideal for boating and enjoying nature. No overt signs of urban development are visible, preserving a strong sense of natural beauty and tranquility in the scene. The overcast sky adds a moody, calm tone to the setting, enhancing the feeling of a quiet escape into nature.","title":"At bridal cave, the niangua river branch of lake of the ozarks Bends sharply, creating a narrow Peninsula","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["557972","550988","551209","558064","550989","551218","543444","550769","551208","550656","550208","550000","555075","548934","550839","550773"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boating","river","embrace","descende","docking","escape","boat","split","preserve","riverside"]}
