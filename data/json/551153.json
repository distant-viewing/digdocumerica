{"path":"551153.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph features a striking scene that juxtaposes a leisurely activity with an industrial backdrop. In the foreground, two individuals, a shirtless young boy and an adult man, are playing table tennis on a makeshift outdoor table. The boy, who is turned with his back facing the camera, sports knee-high striped socks, and dark shorts. The adult, wearing a light-colored shirt and dark trousers, is positioned across the table, engaging in the game.\n\nSet against a vivid rural setting filled with lush greenery, the scene is dominated by four large cooling towers in the background. These towers emit thick, white vapor, reaching up into the blue sky dotted with clouds. The contrast between this recreational scene and the imposing industrial structures enhances the dynamic and somewhat surreal quality of the image. Surrounding vegetation and a glimpse of a structure, possibly a house, to the left frame the setting, creating a compelling interplay between nature, human engagement, and industrial impact.","title":"The Kanawha River separates the towers of the John Amos Power Plant from the little town of Poca, where these boys play pingpong in their backyard.
