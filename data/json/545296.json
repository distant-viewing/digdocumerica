{"path":"545296.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a scenic landscape centered around three vibrant yellow wildflowers in the foreground. These flowers are beautifully detailed, showing hints of green foliage around them. The background flaunts an expansive view of a mountainous terrain with a clear focus on a dramatic mesa formation. The mesa prominently rises from a valley, characterized by a rugged, layered rock face that seems typical of eroded sedimentary structures.\n\nTo the far distance, beneath a subdued sky, mountainous outlines can be discerned, possibly indicating a range or isolated peaks, with patches of snow visible on the highest peak, suggesting altitude and seasonal cold. The vegetation surrounding the area appears to be sparse, consisting of scattered shrubs and trees indicative of a semi-arid environment. Overall, the composition skillfully balances the delicate, lively foreground of wildflowers against the vast, rugged backdrop of mountainous wilderness, creating a striking contrast that captures the essence of a natural landscape.","title":"Yellow arnica blossoms","placename":"Mesa Verde National Park (Colo.)","location":"Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado","nn1":["545723","544938","544881","549018","544443","555666","545562","552442","545703","544887","545719","545727","549228","545718","549225","544894"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mesa","wildflowers","peak","delicate","structur","hints","consiste","discern","rug","altitude"]}
