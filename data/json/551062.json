{"path":"551062.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph shows an industrial scene nestled within a mountainous valley during what appears to be either dawn or dusk. A large plume of smoke or steam rises prominently from what seems to be a factory or plant, located in the center of the valley. The composition is significant for its contrast between the natural landscape—rolling hills and a tree-lined horizon—and the industrial elements depicted by the large facility and the emissions it produces.\n\nThe foreground is somewhat dark and includes glimpses of residential housing, indicating that the area possibly supports a community linked to the industrial activities of the factory. The cloud of smoke/steam, which is the central visual element, is thick and billowing, dispersing upwards into the sky and merging with the clouds above, blurring the separation between man-made and natural elements.\n\nThe sky is divided into bands of color ranging from a dusky blue to lighter shades, suggesting the time of day might be contributing to an almost serene, muted quality in the lighting. This lighting casts a soft glow over the entire scene, highlighting elements of both human habitation and the natural environment surrounding the industrial activity. The overall mood is contemplative, possibly critiquing or reflecting on the intrusion of industrial activities in natural landscapes.","title":"Looking down the Kanawha River Valley from Deepwater toward Alloy where Union Carbide's ferroAlloy plant pollutes the early evening air.","placename":"Charleston (W.
