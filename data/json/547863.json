{"path":"547863.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of a newly constructed residential area, possibly still under development given the unfinished landscaping and rough conditions. In the foreground, the terrain is rough and cluttered with debris, including large rocks, pieces of broken concrete, and muddy puddles. Notably, a large, broken concrete pipe lies prominently in the forefront, adding to the sense of disarray and ongoing construction.\n\nIn the middle and background, a series of identical townhouses with a modern architectural style are visible. These buildings are two stories tall, featuring flat roofs and a combination of muted grey and beige exteriors. Each unit displays large windows and an entry door, some of which are accented in darker colors. There's a uniformity in the design and placement of the townhouses, suggesting they are part of a planned community.\n\nThe overall appearance of the scene is one of transition, capturing the phase of moving from construction to habitation. The landscape is devoid of vegetation, underlining the newness and currently uninhabitable nature of the environment. The atmosphere feels slightly desolate due to the lack of human presence and sparse natural elements.","title":"Sewer pipe ready for installation in Grant City, Staten Island.
