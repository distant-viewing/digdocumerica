{"path":"557407.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an everyday scene featuring an elderly couple outside of a house. The woman stands at the top of a small set of stairs leading to a white door that is partially open. She wears glasses and a loose, knee-length dress with a colorful, comic strip or newspaper-like print. She is leaning on the railing, watching the activity before her.\n\nIn the foreground, an elderly man is engaged in painting or refurbishing a mailbox attached to a masonry wall adjacent to the stairs. The man, sporting white hair, is dressed in a light short-sleeve shirt tucked into his dark slacks, and is also wearing dark shoes. He appears focused on painting, holding a paintbrush and a small can of paint.\n\nThe overall ambiance is domestic and tranquil, with the focus on maintenance and improvement of the home exterior. The walls of the house are dark, contrasting sharply with the bright daylight, hinting at strong sunlight typical in a warm climate. Large windows with white frames are partially visible, adding to the residential feel of the scene. The presence of additional paint cans near the man suggests a work in progress, emphasizing themes of care and upkeep.","title":"Porch gets a coat of paint at a house in Boomer occupied by the elderly couple in the picture. The community is located near the Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant. The houses were built when the plant opened in the mid-1930's and rented to employees who later bought them at bargain prices. Many people in the area still work for the company, and others are retired. Total plant emissions were reduced 97.7 percent between 1967 and 1975. (See fiche #141 to 146)","placename":"Alloy (W.
