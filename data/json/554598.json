{"path":"554598.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural outdoor setting focusing on a bed of small rocks and crushed shells. The ground is interspersed with several larger, darker rocks scattered unevenly across the area. Two significant pieces of wood or bark, weathered and textured, lie on this bed, contributing to the rustic, natural feel of the image. In the foreground, portions of green foliage slightly blur the view, adding depth and framing the central scene gently. The background is indistinct, suggesting a continuation of the natural ground covering and possibly some low-lying plants or shrubs. The setting appears serene, typical of a wooded area or a constructed natural pathway in a park or reserve. No human activity is evident in the scene.","title":"Eastern chipmunk (tamius striatus) in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["558086","543549","558083","555200","547635","551023","547518","554572","550351","553135","543185","544435","550458","552905","554774","551520"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["bed","lie","covering","reserve","continuation","crush","shell","rock","bark","outdoor"]}
