{"path":"547997.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features an urban scene likely captured during a construction or redevelopment period given the visible dirt and debris around the site. The foreground shows a calm water body that reflects the buildings and other objects around it, enhancing the depth of the frame. On the left side of the photograph, a temporary construction bridge can be seen across the water.\n\nThe middle and background areas are filled with various buildings showcasing different architectural styles and eras. Prominent among them is a high-rise building with the signage \"LNB\" on its roof, indicating it might be a bank or corporate facility. Also visible in the skyline is a more modern, circular-shaped building that stands out due to its unique design compared to the mostly rectangular architecture surrounding it.\n\nThis scene is likely part of a downtown area undergoing significant transformations, indicated by the heavy machinery, construction materials, and the general unsettled nature of the space. There is no visible human activity in the immediate view which gives the area a somewhat deserted appearance at the moment of capture. The presence of classic and modern architectural styles together suggests a city that is blending the old with the new.","title":"Site of Expo 74 on the Columbia River.
