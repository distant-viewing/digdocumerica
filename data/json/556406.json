{"path":"556406.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid and active scene of transportation involving multiple modes. In the foreground, a large river is shown with a tugboat actively pushing a barge. The boat, prominently labeled as \"LISA KELCE\" on its starboard side, is navigated by a crew; a person can be seen standing on the rear deck of the tugboat.\n\nDominating the middle ground is a multi-column bridge that spans the river. The bridge has a truss design and appears sturdy, supporting road traffic above. Beneath the bridge structure, various traffic elements can be seen, including a freight train passing parallel to the river. The train consists of several cars, indicating a mix of cargo being transported.\n\nIn the background, directly across the river, stands a densely wooded area, providing a lush green backdrop to the industrial activities taking place in the river and the transportation infrastructure. Just before the treeline, a minor road runs along the riverside, with several cars visible, suggesting routine vehicular movement in this area.\n\nOverall, the composition blends natural and man-made elements and showcases a dynamic environment where water, rail, and road transportation converge in a picturesque, yet industrially intense landscape.","title":"Coal barge on the kanawha river near Charleston, West Virginia.
