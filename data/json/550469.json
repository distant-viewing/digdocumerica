{"path":"550469.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a ground squirrel standing upright in a lush field of tall green grass. The squirrel is holding a bundle of grass in its mouth, likely gathering it either for food or to build a nest. The foreground shows the squirrel clearly, with its fur detailed and showing shades of brown and a hint of soft fur textures. The background is blurred, emphasizing the squirrel and the grass it is holding, and providing a clear focus on the animal's activities. The lighting in the image suggests it may be taken either in the early morning or late afternoon, given the softness of the light and the rich, vibrant colors of the grass. The composition and close-up view highlight the natural behavior of the squirrel in its environment.","title":"This parka squirrel is gathering green grasses to eat during the 9-month winter.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543265","550468","550472","555668","550470","554597","545556","545564","542629","545560","554599","550467","557615","550473","551376","544738"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["fur","grass","nest","bundle","behavior","softness","mouth","food","hold","animal"]}
