{"path":"553209.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a man standing on an escalator, his body partially facing towards the camera. He is dressed in a dark, short-sleeved shirt and patterned pants, and is wearing a watch on his left wrist. The man appears to be looking upwards or out of the frame, suggesting contemplation or distraction.\n\nThe escalator itself is an older model, with metallic steps and side panels. The structure of the escalator and its environment suggest an indoor setting, potentially within an older building or transit system due to the design and visible wear on the steps and handrails.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is dramatic, focusing attention on the man and creating sharp contrasts of light and shadow. This directs the viewerâ€™s eyes primarily towards the man and hints at a more profound narrative or emotional undertone, leaving the impression of a moment captured in time with potential personal or symbolic significance. The escalator moves through a dark, undefined space that fades into the shadows, adding to the enigmatic quality of the image.","title":"Taking the escalator from Fountain Square to the overhead walkway","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["556696","551884","556820","549904","551885","551880","549670","551879","549643","556697","548259","556079","551882","551881","550739","546528"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["step","undertone","handrail","wrist","distraction","watch","man","transit","significance","contemplation"]}
