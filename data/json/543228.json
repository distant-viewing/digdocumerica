{"path":"543228.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at an outdoor event, possibly a fair or community festival, involving a group of children engaged in activities. The setting features lush green grass and bright sunlight.\n\nIn the center of the image stands a large homemade booth with a colorful banner that reads \"Nashville Masterpiece - Mushroom Face.\" This booth has a whimsical design with a large painted flower and a mushroom on its surface. There is an opening in the mushroom where a young child's face is visible, implying that this is a game or photo opportunity where children can pose as the stem of the mushroom.\n\nThe children in the foreground and near the booth mainly appear to be Boy Scouts or Cub Scouts, based on their uniforms which include blue shirts, hats, and neckerchiefs. They are engaged in various activities: some look on at the booth, one boy is blowing into a toy horn, and another boy appears to be reaching towards his pocket, perhaps to retrieve a ticket or token. The group is diverse in terms of age, with both younger and older children present.\n\nThere are festive decorations around the area, including a bunting with alternating orange and green flags hanging in the background, contributing to the lively atmosphere of the event.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a moment of fun and interaction among children at a community or scouting event, highlighted by a creative game stand designed to entertain and engage the participants.","title":"Scout-o-rama","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["554450","551677","543486","558294","551688","551689","546821","551719","556537","557775","548488","549320","543229","556535","545311","544806"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["booth","child","game","event","boy","reache","scout","horn","blow","fun"]}
