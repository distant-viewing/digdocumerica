{"path":"544490.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic highway scene under impending stormy weather. The road runs horizontally across the frame, extending into the distance on the right-hand side. Along the left edge, the image is bordered by a dense row of tall, thin pine trees that lean slightly, indicating strong prevailing winds.\n\nOn the road, three vehicles are visible, traveling away from the point of view. The closest vehicle is a white camper being towed by a creamy-white car. This creates a recreational or travel-related narrative in the image. Further down the road, two more cars are visible, both traveling in the same direction.\n\nThe sky above the scene is dramatic and suggests an approaching storm. It transitions from a light, almost clear state at the horizon, to a dark, threatening mass of storm clouds at the top of the frame. This contrast reinforces the impression of a sudden change in weather conditions.\n\nThe road itself is marked with a dashed center line, suggesting it's likely a two-lane highway with one lane per direction. The shoulder of the road is visible on the right, providing a sense of space and safety.\n\nOverall, the composition captures both a sense of peaceful travel and the imposing nature of natural elements, highlighted by the approaching storm.","title":"U.S. 41, the TaMiami Canal","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544598","545367","544645","554130","551240","554566","545875","553127","544116","554127","548144","547659","556986","554031","547294","557468"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["storm","road","travel","lane","highway","direction","camper","mass","weather","pine"]}
