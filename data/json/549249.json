{"path":"549249.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape scene, likely taken in the late afternoon, given the long shadows and warm light. The foreground features a grassy meadow with distinct lines that may be due to mowing or natural variations in vegetation density. Scattered throughout the meadow are a few prominent conifer trees, standing solitary or in small groups, suggesting a managed or semi-natural landscape.\n\nThe middle of the image is dominated by gently rolling hills, creating a peaceful undulating terrain that adds depth to the scene. These hills are partially covered with a mix of sparse woodland and open grassy areas, showing an ecosystem common in temperate climates.\n\nIn the background, the landscape rises into more pronounced hills or low mountains, hinting at a more rugged natural environment beyond. These are covered with denser forests, adding a dark green hue to the horizon. The skyline is a clear and bright blue, suggesting a clear weather day without visible clouds, which enhances the visibility and crispness of the landscape features.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its layers of meadow, hills, and forested mountains, along with the play of light and shadow, gives it a calm and expansive feel, typical of landscape photography aimed at highlighting natural beauty and tranquility.","title":"The Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation at sunset","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["556990","555567","550667","557519","554402","549139","554722","550604","549155","549236","549218","549146","557099","548025","554982","550602"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["meadow","hill","landscape","conifer","mountain","woodland","photography","aim","undulate","variation"]}
