{"path":"546322.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts the detailed examination of an oyster using a measuring tool. Two hands are seen handling the oyster and measuring device. The oyster is partially open, revealing its internal structure. The measuring tool, which appears to be a type of caliper, is used to measure the thickness or perhaps the size of the oyster.\n\nIn the background, thereâ€™s a hint of more oysters arranged in a grid-like layout, possibly in trays of water, suggesting that the setting might be an oyster farm or a research facility involved in shellfish cultivation or study. The focus and lighting emphasize the oyster and the caliper, drawing attention to the measurement process.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of scientific or agricultural examination, emphasizing precision and study in oyster cultivation.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory: bioassay wet lab.
