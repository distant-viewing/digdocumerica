{"path":"544535.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene with cattle in a waterlogged landscape. The composition features a long, narrow water canal stretching through the center of the image, bordered on each side by grassy, verdant fields. The canal is filled with cattle; some are standing or wading in the water while others are grazing or resting on the grassy banks. \n\nThe terrain is flat and the horizon is far in the distance, suggesting a vast, open area. At the far end of the canal, a lone tree stands slightly off-center, creating a focal point in the landscape. The sky is clear and blue, indicating a sunny day without clouds.\n\nThe overall appearance of the image is serene and pastoral, capturing a moment of rural life where livestock is a central element. The light and colors in the photo suggest it was taken during the day, with natural sunlight enhancing the greens of the grass and the dark tones of the cattle. The reflections of the cattle in the water provide a peaceful, almost symmetrical balance to the scene.","title":"Cattle","placename":"Clewiston (Fla.)","location":"Clewiston, Florida","nn1":["550833","552465","542626","551157","549027","557998","548984","555645","546102","553083","557022","545153","542627","554560","555822","542628"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["cattle","canal","livestock","balance","center","end","bank","water","reflection","day"]}
