{"path":"546111.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a vigorously flowing river burdened with muddy, reddish-brown water which appears thick and heavily laden with silt and debris. The immediate foreground shows frothy, churning water, indicating strong currents or rapids. The middle of the image features calmer but still murky water, collected to form a slightly stagnant pool before merging with the flowing river. Along the riverbank, there's visible accumulation of debris, including twigs, branches, and leaves, suggesting recent heavy rainfall or perhaps flooding. Tree branches hang low over the water in the upper left corner, brushing the river's surface and partially obscuring the view. The overall atmosphere suggests emergency or aftermath of a natural water-related event, emphasizing nature's raw power and the disruption it can bring to terrestrial environments.","title":"White foam contaminates mill creek.
