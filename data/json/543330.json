{"path":"543330.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a dilapidated corrugated metal wall, possibly of an old structure or warehouse. The wall is characterized by significant wear and damage. The corrugated metal panels are rusted and in various states of decay, with the paint heavily chipped and the metal itself corroded and curling at the edges. Several panels are partly torn or punctured, exposing the wooden framework behind them, which is also weathered and discolored.\n\nOn the metal surface, running horizontally across the image, is a dark metal bar that seems to support the structure or is part of the framing. The photo reveals multiple layers of the wallâ€™s construction, indicating years of exposure and neglect.\n\nA small, rectangular sign with the words \"PRIVATE PROPERTY\" is fixed to the lower right part of the wall, adding a human element to the scene and suggesting an attempt to deter trespassing or unauthorized access. The sign itself appears worn, with its white letters slightly faded against a black background, blending into the overall decay of the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is one of abandonment and decay, emphasizing themes of neglect and the passage of time. The composition focuses on textures and patterns created by the corroded metal and weathered wood, providing a rich visual exploration of deterioration. The color palette includes rusty browns, dark greys, and hints of the original paint color beneath the rust.","title":"Monterey bay area","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["547894","543339","543171","551330","544656","554707","543344","543154","556352","544719","557347","552457","552463","553555","543348","543258"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["metal","wall","decay","weathere","panel","rust","corrod","neglect","curl","deterioration"]}
