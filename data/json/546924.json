{"path":"546924.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The image features a rural setting dominated by extensive farmland and traditional farm structures. In the foreground, a large field of crops, possibly strawberries or another low-growing plant, stretches across the scene. Amidst the green leaves, hints of red suggest that the plants are bearing fruit. A person is visible in the field, bent over likely engaged in the task of picking the crops or tending to the plants, wearing a light-colored outfit that contrasts with the greenery.\n\nIn the background, two large barns or farm storage buildings command attention. These structures are traditional in design, characterized by steep roofs and wooden exteriors painted in a reddish hue, typical of farm buildings. Between the two main barns, a smaller, possibly lighter-colored structure can be glimpsed.\n\nThe scene is enclosed by a white fence running across the middle ground, parallel to the horizon, which adds a structured, manicured feel to the otherwise natural landscape. The sky above is clear and vividly blue, indicating a sunny and cloudless day, ideal for farming activities. Overall, the composition captures a serene and productive day on a farm, highlighting agricultural activities and rural architecture.","title":"Strawberry field near route 50","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548296","544481","547303","547291","554055","544552","554029","557520","547447","554078","547304","549222","547426","547321","549237","557946"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["barn","crop","farm","plant","fruit","ten","roofs","manicure","farmland","pick"]}
