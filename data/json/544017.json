{"path":"544017.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a landscape under development or construction in a barren, desert-like setting. The main focal point is a road sign labeled \"EL PUEBLO BLVD\" which is located off to the left side of the image, mounted on a thin metal pole. The road, which the sign presumably names, appears to be unfinished or just being laid out, as indicated by the absence of paved surfaces and the presence of raw, exposed earth.\n\nJust beyond the sign, there are multiple large concrete or metal pipes lying next to each other on the ground, likely waiting to be buried or used as part of infrastructure work, potentially for sewage or drainage. The surrounding terrain is rough and rocky, with sparse vegetation, typical of desert environments.\n\nIn the background, a range of low mountains can be seen under a blue sky with light cloud cover. The area appears to be quite isolated, with no visible buildings or trees, emphasizing the undeveloped nature of the landscape. The setting indicates that this might be an early stage of a larger urban development project.","title":"Labor Day dust storm viewed from Central Avenue, Phoenix storm followed 153-day drought","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["545620","544182","544023","547652","553130","543988","544118","555583","554802","557456","544812","552031","547664","544740","543637","545624"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["desert","development","drainage","sign","project","metal","road","absence","cover","stage"]}
