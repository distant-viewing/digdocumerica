{"path":"546946.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene dominated by a variety of colorful wildflowers, predominantly in shades of pink, covering a meadow-like area. Amidst the flowers, there is an accumulation of discarded items, mostly crumpled aluminum cans and possibly some pieces of paper or wrappers. The litter is somewhat centralized in the image but blends into the natural surroundings due to the overgrowth of the plants around it. The scene underlines a contrast between the natural beauty of the wildflowers and the human-induced waste, subtly highlighting environmental concerns. The overall composition and focus bring attention to the issue of pollution within natural settings.","title":"Flowers and beer cans on St. Helena's Island","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["550353","543676","544651","544640","551247","543056","551440","550687","543589","543664","544652","544298","544648","552100","555228","544644"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["wildflower","overgrowth","aluminum","meadow","pink","litter","accumulation","can","concern","issue"]}
