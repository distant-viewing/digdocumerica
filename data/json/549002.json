{"path":"549002.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on a desolate road during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, judging by the soft, dim lighting and long shadows. A lone car, which looks like a classic model from perhaps the 1970s or 1980s, is driving towards the camera but is positioned at a significant distance. The car is on a straight section of the road, which visibly undulates and bends slightly as it extends into the distance.\n\nThe road itself is framed by sparse, dry landscape typical of a desert-like environment, characterized by low scrub and barren terrain. On either side of the road, the ground appears rugged and uneven, supporting very little vegetation. The horizon shows gentle rises and dips of the terrain, adding to the isolated and remote feel of the landscape.\n\nUtility poles run parallel to the road, reinforcing the direction of the road and adding a sense of depth to the scene. The poles are evenly spaced and cast long shadows across the road, contributing to the overall mood of the photograph, which is quiet, solitary, and somewhat nostalgic. The lighting condition, along with the long shadows, also creates a play of light and dark across the scene, highlighting textures and contours of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with its central road leading the eye towards the horizon, the lone vehicle, and the expansive, open environment, evokes a sense of solitude and the vastness of the open road.","title":"Highway through desert near Colorado river.
