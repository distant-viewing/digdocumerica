{"path":"550725.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a somber industrial scene dominated by shades of purple and muted tones. In the foreground, a large river spans the frame horizontally, its surface a tapestry of swirling grey and purple hues that reflect a turbulent or polluted state. Beyond the river, a dense thicket of trees forms a natural barrier, their foliage dark and barely discernible under the overcast sky.\n\nIn the background, central to the composition, industrial structures rise above the treeline. Multiple smokestacks are visible, emitting thick plumes of dark smoke that billow upward and blend into the gray, overcast sky, suggesting significant air pollution. The industrial site seems active, possibly a factory or a power plant, contributing to the environmental impact depicted.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is moody and somber, highlighting themes of industrialization and its environmental consequences. The color saturation and lighting conditions add a dramatic feel, emphasizing the ongoing activity and environmental issues associated with the scene. The photograph likely serves as a commentary on pollution and environmental degradation.","title":"View of the androscoggin river from the bridge at jay international paper company mill in background","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["550710","545268","550181","546705","545447","545239","547122","557218","557225","547084","557376","544294","550172","547539","550176","557246"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["pollution","thicket","consequence","treeline","industrialization","tapestry","commentary","saturation","swirl","degradation"]}
