{"path":"556242.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph shows a large crowd of spectators, densely packed in an outdoor venue, with many individuals holding open umbrellas. The umbrellas display a variety of colors and patterns including yellows, blues, whites, and florals, creating a colorful mosaic across the image.\n\nThe scene suggests that the audience is gathered for an event, possibly awaiting a performance or watching one, given the setup of seating which includes rows of benches or folding chairs. The presence of umbrellas suggests it might be a sunny day or there is a possibility of rain.\n\nPeople of various ages and attire can be glimpsed beneath the umbrellas, but their features are largely obscured by the density and coverage of the umbrellas. The crowd is diverse, with both younger and older individuals visible.\n\nThe background and far views are mostly obscured by the sea of umbrellas, giving no clear indication of the nature of the event or specific location, but it appears to be a daytime setting given the overall lighting.\n","title":"Members of the jehovah's witnesses during the group's annual convention at Chicago's sox park, a baseball field on the city's south side.
