{"path":"546603.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a highway environment, displaying a heavy traffic situation. The image captures a multilane highway winding through a lush, green landscape. The highway is busy, with many lanes filled with cars extending far back into the distance, underlining the congestion.\n\nTo the right, the highway travels through a densely wooded area, showcasing a rich array of green foliage. A curve in the road is noticeable towards the bottom right region, where the highway neatly snakes alongside a body of water, possibly a river, visible on the left-hand side of the highway. This river appears calm and is surrounded by trees, enhancing the natural and serene environment amidst the bustling traffic. \n\nThe aerial viewpoint allows a comprehensive view of both the natural surroundings and the human-made infrastructure, creating a contrast between the busy human activity and the tranquility of the natural environment. The overcast lighting adds a slightly muted tone to the colors within the scene, suggesting it might be either late afternoon or a cloudy day. \n\nIn the distance beyond the immediate focus of the highway and trees, more patches of green fields and sparse areas of development are visible, potentially indicating either residential areas or further expanses of natural land, adding layers to the landscape's composition.","title":"Beltway bridge over the Potomac River looking southwest the Beltway circles Virginia and Maryland suburbs providing high speed access to points in the District.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546587","546714","546733","546721","546725","546720","546711","546583","546607","546734","546612","546686","548391","546571","546709","546713"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","multilane","traffic","congestion","situation","river","viewpoint","lane","distance","curve"]}
