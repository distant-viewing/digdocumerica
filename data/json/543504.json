{"path":"543504.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The image predominantly features an informational sign set against a rugged natural backdrop. The sign is made of wood and is directly supported by robust dark wood posts at each side. It appears quite weathered, indicative of being exposed to the elements over time. The message on the sign details the geological history of the area, specifically discussing the exposes of the basaltic lava flow from nearby volcanic activity, which happened millions of years ago. The text talks about how these lava flows have formed the landscape, mentioning various geological processes like cooling and cracking of the basalt into columns and subsequent erosion by a glacier.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows a chaotic jumble of grey stone rubble, likely basalt rocks that have fragmented over time. These rocks seem to be rough and irregular, adding to the rugged texture of the scene. No sky or vegetation is visible, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the geological aspects highlighted by the sign and the rocks. \n\nThe lighting in the photo suggests it might be taken during a bright day, given the shadows cast by the signposts and the visible details on the rocky surface. This kind of educational display is typical in national parks or protected natural areas to inform visitors about the geological significance and natural history of the surroundings.","title":"California -- yosemite","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["543131","555084","554410","552685","555158","543721","544450","551233","552444","552546","544363","545591","553770","552890","545805","555592"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["lava","history","sign","rock","expose","jumble","signpost","glacier","flow","cool"]}
