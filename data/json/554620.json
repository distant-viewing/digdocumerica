{"path":"554620.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image depicts a deer intently feeding from a wooden trough placed in a natural setting. The deer, with its light brown fur and visible white patches, is positioned in profile and is leaning over to reach the contents of the trough, which appears to be grains or corn. The setting is a wooded area, evidenced by the green foliage and trunks of trees visible in the background. The foreground shows a bit of grass and some soil, enhancing the feel of a natural, outdoor environment. The lighting suggests it might be midday, with sufficient natural light illuminating the scene, enriching the colors and details of the deer and its surroundings. The focus and framing are centered on capturing the action of the deer as it feeds.","title":"White-tailed doe at a feeding trough atop mccauley mountain near Old Forge, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["544916","546088","552339","546163","554621","544114","542778","545902","550804","544623","543279","546198","558368","550803","542963","544571"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","trough","feed","corn","fur","grain","enrich","midday","framing","profile"]}
