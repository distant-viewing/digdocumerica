{"path":"552630.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a nighttime scene on a lit football field during what appears to be a practice or team meeting. The main focus of the image is a group of high school or college football players and a coach. The players, in full gear including helmets, pads, and jerseys, are attentively gathered in a huddle or line, facing another figure who is likely giving instructions or a pep talk. Most of the jerseys bear the number label, with visible numbers such as \"25,\" \"62,\" and \"70,\" among others.\n\nTo the right foreground, a coach or possibly another player, stands apart from the group, leaning on crutches, suggesting a leg injury. This individual is dressed in dark pants, a lighter shirt, and a dark jacket, actively observing the group. His expression and stance indicate engagement and perhaps leadership, even though physically set aside due to injury.\n\nThe illumination comes from lights around the field, casting a glare and establishing a dramatic nighttime sports setting. The background is dark, emphasizing the nighttime setting, with some ambient light highlighting players' helmets and parts of their equipment.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is one of focus and anticipation, capturing a moment of strategic planning or team bonding in the sport environment.","title":"Rifle versus Aspen High School football game.
