{"path":"554581.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image presents a close-up view of a single orchid flower. The orchid appears vibrant and delicate, primarily featuring a large, bulbous, yellow pouch which is the most distinctive part of the flower. Above the pouch, two long, slender petals stretch upward and outward; they are brown with lighter, perhaps white or pale yellow, veining which gives them a textured appearance. Two lateral sepals can be seen flanking the pouch, similar in color and texture to the upper petals, contributing to a symmetrical aesthetic. \n\nThe background of the photograph is uniformly dark, creating a stark contrast that highlights the intricate details and colors of the orchid. The focus and lighting concentrate on the orchid, enhancing its colors and the delicate veins on its petals. The angle of the photograph provides a slightly front-facing, upward view, emphasizing the graceful arch of the petals and the fullness of the orchid's pouch. The overall composition is simple yet elegant, showcasing the natural beauty of the orchid against a void of dark space, thus drawing all attention to the subject.","title":"Yellow lady slipper (Cypripedium pubescens), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554580","554586","553369","554112","554840","554582","550464","543623","555035","545699","553366","553365","544875","543596","555033","547613"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["petal","flower","vein","arch","aesthetic","color","angle","subject","view","appearance"]}
