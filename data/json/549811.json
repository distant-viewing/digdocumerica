{"path":"549811.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph is characterized by a deep red filter effect that saturates the entire scene. It features a low-hanging sun centered near the horizon, casting an intense, circular glow. The foreground includes a series of rooftop antennas or television aerials that stretch vertically into the frame, their lines shadowed and distinct against the red sky.\n\nBelow the antennas, the silhouette of rooftop edges and other urban structures can be faintly seen, creating a layered effect. One particular antenna closer to the right edge stands out by its solitary positioning and clearer silhouette against the sky, indicating that the location is likely an urban area. The red hue of the image adds a dramatic, somewhat eerie mood to the scene, emphasizing the outlines and shapes of the objects within the photograph. The overall composition balances the mechanical, human-made structures with the natural phenomenon of the sun, encapsulated within a singular, monochromatic color scheme.","title":"Television antennas at sunset, Upper Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549805","549826","555164","543410","544082","544020","545418","542678","552896","542679","542680","552337","543969","544090","544011","548851"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["antenna","rooftop","television","phenomenon","silhouette","sun","effect","filter","positioning","scheme"]}
