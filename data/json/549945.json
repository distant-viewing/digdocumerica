The main object is a large garbage truck with its back end opened, showing an immense amount of trash spilling out onto the ground. The truck is colored green and grey and appears to be very sturdy and heavy-duty, designed for waste management purposes.\n\nIn the foreground, a man is seen interacting with the truck. He is standing on the left side of the image, gripping the side of the truck. The man appears to be in a physically active role, possibly a worker tasked with managing or assisting in the dumping process. He wears a blue t-shirt, dark shorts, and boots, suggesting a practical outfit suitable for a rugged, dirty environment.\n\nThe background of the image is predominantly more waste and debris spread out over the ground, indicating that the location is a large-scale waste disposal facility. The ground is uneven and littered with numerous objects and trash, creating a chaotic and cluttered environment.\n\nThis photograph provides a stark visualization of waste management in action, highlighting both the scale of waste produced and the labor involved in handling it.","title":"Dumping garbage at the Croton landfill operation","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["549940","549749","549949","546761","549936","549746","549743","543821","546257","547208","547975","549751","546231","549750","549792","549795"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","truck","trash","management","dumping","spill","grip","scale","landfill","produce"]}
