{"path":"543252.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph presents a serene beach scene captured in silhouette. On the right side, two individuals are visible walking along the sandy shore, depicted in profile as dark outlines against the reflective surface of the water. The ocean in the background glimmers brightly under what appears to be strong light, possibly sunlight, enhancing the sparkling surface of the water with numerous white highlights.\n\nThe left and bottom foreground prominently features a rugged cliff, densely covered with dark green vegetation, which frames the beach scene. The cliff's ledge gradually recedes towards the top left corner of the image, adding a natural depth and contrast to the composition.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is peaceful, emphasizing the vastness and beauty of the natural coastal environment. The contrasting elements - the dark, textured cliff and the shimmering, expansive ocean - draw attention to the small human figures, highlighting their interaction with the vastness of nature.","title":"California--Garrapata Beach","placename":"Garrapata State Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557509","542890","543287","554159","547600","543493","543085","546953","555400","557470","543237","548088","547612","543089","543299","547607"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["cliff","vastness","ocean","glimmer","beach","ledge","recede","profile","corner","surface"]}
