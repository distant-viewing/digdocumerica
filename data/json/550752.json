{"path":"550752.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene in an urban park setting. The focus is on a multi-level water feature, with a large fountain spraying water upwards in the background and a cascade flowing broadly down a series of steps. The atmosphere is vibrant, framed by green trees and a notable background of a large multi-story building, likely an office structure given its formal design and large windows.\n\nThe scene is populated with various individuals engaged in casual, leisurely activities, indicative of a warm, sunny day. There are people seated on concrete benches and on the steps near the water feature, suggesting a place popular for relaxation and social gatherings. For instance, in the foreground, a couple is engaged in conversation while seated on a bench. Close by, another individual appears to be reading a document or small book, enjoying the tranquility alone.\n\nThe design of the park highlights both structural and natural elements, combining stone, water, and vegetation effectively to create a welcoming public space. The shot is lit by natural sunlight, which dapples through the leaves of the trees, creating patterns of light and shadow on the brick paving and water. This image not only captures a specific moment but also conveys the broader use of the space as a communal area within an urban environment.","title":"Splash and sparkle of cool water--balm for the dog days City Hall Plaza","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550747","551772","550762","551449","552703","557282","557258","547784","551647","551667","551793","557268","550075","550302","551663","552737"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["step","bench","instance","paving","cascade","park","water","document","fountain","space"]}
