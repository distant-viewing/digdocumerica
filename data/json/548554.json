{"path":"548554.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures two people in a bright yellow paddle boat on a body of water. The paddle boat is equipped with a yellow canopy that matches the body of the boat and appears to provide some shade. There's an older man seated near the rear of the boat; he is steering the boat and holds onto a control handle. He's wearing sunglasses, a blue patterned Hawaiian shirt, and shorts. Seated in front of him is a young girl wearing a bright red life jacket and appears to be relaxed or observing the surroundings.\n\nThe water around the boat is calm with light ripples, suggesting a gentle movement through the water. The environment indicates a leisurely activity, likely on a sunny day due to the attire worn by the individuals and the need for a canopy on the boat. The background features the open water, blending into a pale blue sky at the horizon. This setup results in a peaceful, recreational scene often associated with vacation or family time outdoors.","title":"Paddle-boating on one of the lakes in the Century Village retirement community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["544270","546352","548553","546356","543942","553411","544980","546976","553800","551255","551309","553409","553403","551308","552123","547451"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","paddle","canopy","vacation","steer","need","seat","rear","result","relax"]}
