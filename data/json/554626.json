{"path":"554626.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil natural landscape featuring a large body of still water, reflecting the sky and some of the elements above it. The main focus is a pair of large, circular culverts situated underneath a road. These culverts partially submerged in water, provide a channel allowing water flow beneath the road. The surrounding area consists of rugged terrain with gentle rolling hills primarily covered in sparse vegetation and scattered rocks, suggesting a somewhat arid region.\n\nIn the background, the hills rise higher and are shrouded by mist or low-hanging clouds, creating a serene and slightly mysterious atmosphere. Among the sparse vegetation on the hills, a few trees, notably a white-birch-like tree with a bare trunk, stand out sharply against the mostly monochromatic hillside. No people or animals are visible in the scene, emphasizing its quiet, untouched character.\n\nThe upper part of the image shows a cloudy sky, which casts soft, diffuse light across the scene, further enhancing the calm and peaceful mood of the landscape. The color palette is mostly composed of blues, greens, and earth tones, contributing to the natural and serene vibe of the image.","title":"Huge pile of old and new tailings from the titanium (ilmenite) mine owned by NL Industries at Tahawus, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
