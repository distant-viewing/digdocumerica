{"path":"556023.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph provides a bird's-eye view of an indoor seating area arranged in a clean, organized grid pattern. The floor is tiled with large square tiles in alternating tones of gray. Rows of contemporary chairs are neatly lined up. Each row has chairs facing opposite to the one behind, positioned back-to-back. The chairs differ in color—alternating between vibrant red, black, and white—adding a pop of visual interest.\n\nSeated on these chairs are various individuals, mostly seen from the back or side, deeply engaged in various activities. Some appear to be alone, possibly engrossed in thought, while others are in pairs and small groups, actively conversing or sharing a meal. The overall setup suggests a public space designed for relaxation, casual dining, or social interaction, emphasizing communal but individually distinct experiences.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, focusing on the alignment and color contrast of the chairs, coupled with the candid capture of everyday human interaction, provides a dynamic yet harmonious scene. The positioning and perspective of the shot highlight both the individuality of the people and the uniformity of the design.","title":"Modern seating arrangement contrasts with the older stone flooring in Union Station at Kansas City, Missouri. Only a portion of the massive station is used for passengers of Amtrak. The remainder has been converted into a convention center. Six passenger trains per day stop here compared to more than 200 during the heyday of rail service.","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["551801","546511","551487","546526","556000","551803","555290","549657","546515","546500","551320","558211","551634","549897","556627","546519"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["chair","back","row","alignment","uniformity","pop","dining","tile","capture","meal"]}
