{"path":"543311.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a striking silhouette view against a bright and shimmering seascape. The main subject is a large rock formation that strikingly resembles the profile of a bear or a large animal, positioned on the left side of the frame. The silhouette of the rock forms a distinct and rugged outline against the bright backlighting. The ocean in the background is sparkling under sunlight, with waves that appear to be gently hitting the shore, suggesting a peaceful, albeit bright, coastal setting.\n\nThe background features additional rock formations which are smaller and positioned distantly along the coast, contributing to the rugged coastal ambiance. The sky is almost clear with a hint of possible light flares created by the bright sunlight, which adds to the dramatic backlighting effect and emphasizes the silhouette prominence of the rock formation in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a serene yet powerful nature scene, utilizing high contrast between the shadowed foreground and the luminous background. The composition artfully plays with light and form, subtly guiding the viewer's attention through the scene from the boldly defined foreground to the radiant seascape beyond.","title":"California--Garrapata Beach","placename":"Garrapata State Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543127","553852","543046","542808","544985","545173","543250","543068","543252","542890","543060","557508","543081","543307","545126","545117"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["backlighting","seascape","rock","formation","silhouette","flare","prominence","coast","sunlight","profile"]}
