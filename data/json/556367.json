{"path":"556367.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene within a mining environment. A male miner is captured in a crouching position, deep inside a mine. He's wearing a hard hat equipped with a headlamp, a dark colored jacket and trousers, and boots covered with mud. Attached to his belt is a battery pack, likely for powering his headlamp. The environment around him is rugged and quite dark, characterized by rock surfaces with visible geological layers. The ceiling of the mine is low, forcing the miner to stoop, and it is supported by wooden beams and posts. Puddles reflect the light, suggesting the presence of water within the mine. Thereâ€™s a cable or rope strung horizontally across the scene, indicating possible areas of work or pathways within the mine. The mineral-rich strata of the mine walls glisten slightly, hinting at the presence of possibly coal or another mineral extraction. Overall, the image gives a sense of the tough and dimly lit conditions faced by miners.","title":"George wilson in his drift mine (one that is cut straight into a hill) near Wilder and Cookeville, Tennessee.  It was closed down by federal mine inspectors because he lacked a non-arcing drill wilson said such a drill and allied equipment would cost him $100,000 to reopen the mine.  Note the height of the shaft.  The lines on the side are called escape wires which a miner could use to find his way to safety in the event of a mine disaster","placename":"Cookeville (Tenn.)","location":"Cookeville, Tennessee","nn1":["556358","556510","543775","556357","556364","556365","556427","556397","556396","556366","556319","556359","556363","556509","556515","556360"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Miner"],"terms":["mine","miner","headlamp","stoop","strata","string","glisten","beams","extraction","coal"]}
