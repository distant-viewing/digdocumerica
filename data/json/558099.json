{"path":"558099.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, rural landscape featuring a white building with a classic architectural design, prominently standing at a road fork. The building, possibly a historical house or community building, features a prominent central entrance flanked by windows and a central upper window under a decorative gable. A streetlight hangs overhead near the building, adding a small urban element to the otherwise natural setting.\n\nThe roads are unpaved and curve around the building, leading off into different directions, bordered by lush green trees and some grassy areas on the sides. The left path slightly ascends, while the right path curves gently around the building. The sky above is partly cloudy with fluffy white clouds, suggesting a bright sunny day.\n\nThe overall composition creates a picturesque, pastoral scene that is calm and inviting, likely representing a small town or rural community area. The ample greenery and the prominence of nature in the scene emphasize a peaceful and quiet environment.","title":"Boston, Ohio, community church at Hines Hill and Boston Mills Roads south of Cleveland.
