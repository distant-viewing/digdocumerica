{"path":"546172.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene from an industrial or scrapyard setting. On the left side, there is a structure, possibly a storage silo or processing tower, which appears to be constructed of metal, predominantly white and silver, with some rust visible at the joints and edges. It sits on metallic stilts over a pile of what seems to be crushed stone or gravel, which is mound-shaped and occupies the base of the structure.\n\nTo the right of the structure, dominating much of the image, is a massive heap of compressed and tangled cars. The cars are stacked chaotically on top of each other in various states of destruction, with many showing significant damage, crushed parts, and peeling paint. The colors of the cars vary widely, including green, red, blue, and more muted tones like gray and black.\n\nThe background is fairly plain and nondescript, giving the impression that the focus is entirely on the industrial activity in the foreground. The sky above is clear, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a day with good weather. This scene likely captures a moment related to the recycling or disposal of automobiles, highlighting the scale and environmental impact of such operations.","title":"AutoMobile junk yard","placename":"Corpus Christi (Tex.)","location":"Corpus Christi, Texas","nn1":["545545","554320","552738","554352","554348","551517","542656","553011","547621","554311","542660","553006","544819","551547","552765","546260"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","stilt","scrapyard","recycling","destruction","disposal","silver","heap","automobile","silo"]}
