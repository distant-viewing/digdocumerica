{"path":"547507.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a busy and vibrant beach scene. In the foreground, two women are seated on a white towel, facing away from the camera. They appear to be in conversation, with one woman wearing a light-colored bra and denim shorts, and the other in a black bikini top. The scene around them is bustling with beachgoers engaged in various activities. People are mostly dressed in swimwear, lounging on towels or milling about. \n\nTo the left, a man in blue shorts and a woman in a white swimsuit are standing and conversing. Several people are seen sunbathing, lying flat on their towels. The center shows a man walking and looking at something in his hand, possibly a small object or a shell. Near him, a woman in a white bikini top is seen making adjustments to her bikini bottom.\n\nIn the background, the sandy beach stretches out towards the water where more people are visible either standing in shallow waters or walking along the shore. The ocean waves appear calm and there is no visible horizon line due to the angle of the photograph. The overall atmosphere is lively yet relaxed, typical of a sunny day at the beach where people come to unwind and enjoy the outdoors. The sky is clear and there are no visible buildings or structures, suggesting a natural beach setting.","title":"Misquamicut state beach","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["548541","546794","550936","546768","547680","547503","547491","550932","547628","553685","550931","550919","553683","547482","550929","550923"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["bikini","towel","beach","woman","short","adjustment","swimwear","beachgoer","sunbathe","lounge"]}
