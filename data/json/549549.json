{"path":"549549.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph provides a panoramic view of Niagara Falls and its surroundings. The image primarily captures the powerful cascade of the falls, with mist rising from where the water strikes the river below. We see the water flowing over the cliff in a wide, uninterrupted swath, suggesting this is the Horseshoe Falls section of Niagara Falls.\n\nOn the left side of the image is a lush green foreground where a grassy hill slopes gently down towards the falls. This viewpoint offers a wide, scenic look at the river, which flows tumultuously as it carries huge volumes of water.\n\nTo the right of the falls, there's a viewing area where numerous visitors are gathered to watch and take in the sight. This spot is bounded by low barriers and has pathways where people can walk and enjoy the scene. Adjacent to this, there is a road with some vehicles, reflecting a busy tourist area.\n\nAcross the river, the background features an urban landscape with tall buildings including hotels and a distinctive tower, which is likely the Skylon Tower, given its shape and proximity to the falls. To the right, a bridge spans the river, likely the Rainbow Bridge connecting Canada and the United States. The sky is partly cloudy but bright, suggesting a pleasant day perfect for tourists visiting this natural spectacle.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures both the natural beauty of Niagara Falls and the human engagement with this majestic landmark.","title":"View from Goat Island, which lies in the Niagara River at the brink of the falls, and divides the cataract into two parts.
