{"path":"557911.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph features two men working on an open car engine, in what appears to be a garage setting. The man on the right is leaning over into the engine bay, holding a wrench and appears to be working on the car. He is dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt and appears focused on the task at hand. The second man, on the left, is partially visible and is holding up the hood of the car while observing the other man's work, dressed in dark clothes with a patterned tie.\n\nThe setting includes a blurred background with a glimpse of a vending machine, suggesting the indoor environment of a repair shop or garage. The lighting is dim, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the men and their work on the bright and reflective surfaces of the car's engine and open hood. The overall mood is serious and professional, with a focus on mechanical or automotive repair.","title":"Motorist in the left background waits as an employee of an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati tries to locate why the vehicle failed its inspection. The owner had spent $82 on repairs after receiving a $10 ticket for an invalid sticker, and the fine was due to double. A new rotor was needed for the car to pass the test on an exhaust analyzer which reads carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions.
