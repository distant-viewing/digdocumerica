{"path":"546615.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a candid street scene focused on a woman waiting at a bus stop. She is dressed in a dark, tailored coat and accessorized with large sunglasses and a dark handbag held in her left hand, which is clasped by her right hand at waist level. Her posture and expression exhibit a sense of attentiveness or perhaps impatience.\n\nThe bus stop sign, attached to what appears to be a tree trunk, is laden with multiple circular and rounded rectangular signs indicating various bus schedules and routes including services by \"D.C. Transit\" and for Virginia buses. The sign provides information like \"BUS STOP Mon. thru Fri. Except Hol.\" and includes specific mentions of \"Express Service\" and \"Allnight\" service. \n\nIn the background, there is a blurred city street where other individuals can be seen walking or standing. A man wearing a trench coat is partially visible, walking in the opposite direction. The environment suggests an urban setting with elements like a broad sidewalk and a pavement, which hint at a moderately busy city area.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a typical urban moment caught in the mid to late 20th century, focusing on the waiting experience at a public transportation hub.","title":"K Street, NW","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556799","556786","546650","556804","546666","549644","556809","556742","548608","546655","546592","557904","547195","556203","556744","546605"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["bus","service","coat","mention","waiting","schedule","attentiveness","trench","handbag","sign"]}
