{"path":"557788.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph features a man engaging in playing a large accordion. He appears to be in his mid-thirties, wearing a distinctive outfit that suggests traditional or folk attire, including a dark cap, a scarf tied around his neck, and a collared shirt. His expression is focused and slightly expressive, suggesting he is deeply immersed in the music he is creating.\n\nThe accordion is notable for its size and color; it has a deep red and white pattern with prominent metal grillework on the side facing the camera, displaying the instrument's brand logo. The man's fingers are positioned on the white and black keys, indicating active play.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, primarily consisting of warm, muted tones that suggest an outdoor setting under a tent or a canopy, as indicated by the edge of a structure and the soft, diffused lighting, possibly daylight. There is no distinct activity or other subjects visible in the immediate background, focusing the viewer's attention squarely on the musician and his instrument.","title":"Visitors to the annual Oktoberfest at Helen heard traditional German folksongs by one of two German ski instructors on leave from a nearby North Georgia ski resort. The small mountain village of some 270 people was typical of communities in the area until 1969. At that time residents endorsed Renovation of the business district with a Bavarian Alpine theme. Success of the project has led to an increase in tourism and new Alpine development that will double present facilities.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["558359","558263","558358","558283","558354","558355","548607","548606","558334","548262","558224","558213","558387","556311","548560","556305"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["instrument","key","folk","thirty","play","musician","immerse","finger","scarf","music"]}
