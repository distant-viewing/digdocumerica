{"path":"550740.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph that captures a striking and dynamic natural landscape, possibly of a salt lake or a mineral-rich water body. The image features a complex, swirling pattern of colors and textures.\n\nThe left side of the image displays a dark black or deep purple area that seems to be a body of water with a granular texture, possibly indicating the presence of small waves or ripples. Transitioning from this, there are several islands or mineral deposits in rich earthy tones, such as dark browns and beiges, showing rugged textures indicative of rough, arid terrain.\n\nThe central and right portions of the image are dominated by mesmerizing swirls of white, pink, and purple hues, flowing in a fluid, marble-like pattern. These areas might denote different mineral concentrations in the water, each color possibly representing a different mineral or salinity level.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a breathtaking view of natural geological formations from an aerial perspective, highlighting the beauty and complexity of mineral interplay in aquatic environments. The scene is devoid of any human activity or man-made structures, emphasizing its pristine and untouched nature.","title":"Foam on the polluted Androscoggin River, seen from the North Bridge at Lewiston, textile center and second largest city in the state.","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["546110","552426","552920","550400","555705","555860","544679","552424","555626","545623","550816","548974","553867","552887","544685","550397"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mineral","swirl","marble","fluid","texture","denote","salt","deposit","beige","island"]}
