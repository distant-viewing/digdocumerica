{"path":"551569.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a blend of industrial and residential areas. The image prominently features a large industrial complex in the center and upper right sections, characterized by several large buildings including massive warehouses or factories with flat roofs. Some of these factory buildings emit smoke, suggesting ongoing industrial activity.\n\nIn addition to the factories, there are multiple railroad tracks that traverse the image horizontally, with several freight cars parked along them, indicating the areaâ€™s use for heavy transportation and logistic operations.\n\nThe lower and middle left of the photo depicts a residential neighborhood. This area includes rows of houses with pitched roofs, neatly organized yards, and tree-lined streets. These homes appear small compared to the large scale of the industrial buildings nearby, highlighting a stark contrast between the residential and industrial sections of the area.\n\nThe overall environment includes patches of greenery, especially noticeable around the residential zone, and a few scattered trees in the industrial section. The picture captures a vibrant yet contrasting view of industrial and residential coexistence, typical in many towns where industries form an integral part of the local economy and landscape.","title":"Con-wed plant at cloquet, Minnesota., discharges \"white water\" into a side channel of the st.
