{"path":"544319.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural farming scene featuring two individuals on a red tractor plowing a field. The person driving the tractor is seated, while the other is standing on a side step, both facing forward. The tractor is old-fashioned, possibly a Massey Ferguson, based on the design and emblem visible on the front.\n\nThe field appears freshly plowed, evidenced by the dark, upturned soil in the foreground, contrasting with a greener field in the background. The tractor is generating a cloud of dust and debris, suggesting dry soil conditions and active plowing.\n\nThe background includes dense trees and shrubs under a dusky or overcast sky, suggesting it might be either early morning or late evening, which adds a moody, muted tone to the lighting. The color saturation is rich, emphasizing deep greens and the red of the tractor, which stands out vividly against the earthy tones of the field and the subdued colors of the background.\n\nThis image conveys a sense of hard work typical of agricultural practices and highlights a moment of cooperation and activity in a rural setting.","title":"Navajo boys plow corn field on the Navajo reservation.","placename":"Shiprock (N.M.)","location":"Shiprock, New Mexico","nn1":["557521","547436","554204","555878","545893","553665","542533","544888","557753","544323","555879","547690","547297","552577","548903","557697"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["tractor","field","cooperation","soil","emblem","saturation","practice","highlight","dust","farming"]}
