{"path":"553208.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features three elderly men seated on a bench in an urban park setting. The bench is located next to lush green shrubbery and a few trees, emphasizing a serene atmosphere commonly found in well-maintained city parks. The focus is on the interaction among the men who are dressed distinctly, reflecting their individual styles and perhaps different facets of their lives.\n\nFrom left to right: The first man is dressed casually in a gray flat cap, dark long-sleeve shirt, and sporty, light-colored pants. He also wears white sneakers, and his posture is slightly hunched as he sits with his hands clasped and legs apart.\n\nThe second man, seated in the middle, wears a more formal attire with a light-colored fedora, a dark suit, and a white shirt. His look is completed with polished black shoes. He appears animated in the midst of a conversation, gesturing with his right hand towards the third man.\n\nThe third man, on the right, is also dressed formally in a dark suit and tie with a white shirt. His posture is more relaxed as he sits with his hands on his lap, attentively listening to the second man. He wears glasses and has a gentle, engaged expression.\n\nThe environment around these men subtly indicates a tranquil city scene, where a paved walkway can be glimpsed through the gaps in the lush foliage, hinting at the presence of a well-visited park conducive to leisure and conversation. The photograph captures a moment of engagement and relaxed camaraderie among the three men, set against a backdrop that showcases urban greenery, blending nature with city life.","title":"Colloquy on a wall at Fountain Square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["555991","552727","547359","552722","547443","557713","548647","548646","551815","551646","555599","548645","553558","549293","557079","554026"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["man","bench","city","suit","hand","animate","posture","park","fedora","conversation"]}
