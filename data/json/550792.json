{"path":"550792.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a large tree trunk, noticeably robust and ancient, with a rich texture of bark and moss. The tree, centered in the frame, extends upward out of the view, indicating its considerable height. It has a gnarled and mossy surface, suggesting it has weathered many seasons.\n\nThe angle of the shot places emphasis on the trunkâ€™s rugged surface and organic irregularities, such as bumps and crevices, which are covered in patches of green moss and lichen, adding a touch of vivid natural color to the dark brown bark.\n\nIn the background, the environment is densely forested with various shades of green. Light filters through the canopy, casting patches of sunlight and shadow over the scene and creating a moody, somewhat mystical lighting effect. There are no human figures or man-made objects visible; the focus is solely on the natural beauty of the tree and its forest setting. The background is blurry, which gives a soft contrast to the sharpness of the tree trunk in the foreground. This technique emphasizes the tree while blending it with the serene and untouched forest atmosphere.","title":"Lichen-covered tree","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["557616","554974","557621","545278","555000","543488","554999","554977","555008","542958","542749","554995","555057","548687","554975","554985"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["trunk","bark","moss","forest","mossy","sharpness","tree","crevice","technique","emphasis"]}
