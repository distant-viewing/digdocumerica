{"path":"549591.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and colorful scene on the deck of a large ship. The ship's hull is painted in bright red and green, with the red section making up the majority of the visible area. The green stripe runs along the bottom part of the hull. Notably, the ship features a painted scale on the hull, with numbers indicating the depth or draft of the ship in feet, from 16 to 21 feet.\n\nOn the upper part of the red hull, two crew members are engaging in maintenance work. They are wearing safety helmets and are slightly elevated above the deck in what appears to be either a suspended platform or some sort of harness system attached to the ship. They seem to be involved in either cleaning, painting, or performing some technical task on the ship.\n\nThe equipment and architecture of the ship suggest a commercial or industrial vessel, possibly a cargo ship, given the large structures and pulleys overhead. The intense blue sky in the background contrasts sharply with the vivid red of the ship's hull, highlighting the figures and their activity. This combination of elements gives the photograph an energetic and industrially themed composition.","title":"The \"martin karlsen,\" a canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical biological and meteorological conditions in lake superior.
