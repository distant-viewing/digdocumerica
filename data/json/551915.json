{"path":"551915.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts an older man in military attire, prominently featuring various medals and ribbons on his chest. He is seated behind a table, resting his hands neatly on top, suggesting a posed and formal posture. The man appears earnest with a slight smile, and his graying hair is neatly combed back.\n\nThe table in front of him displays a series of rectangular, color-coded objects. These seem to be informational tiles or samples, each marked with different labels and colors, possibly representing some kind of systematized information or status indicators.\n\nIn the background, there is a large, complex map overlaid with various markings, symbols, and lines connecting different nodes. This appears to be a strategic or operational map, possibly military or for transportation/logistics purposes, as suggested by various symbols and the structured nature of the layout. The map uses various shades of beige, yellow, and gray, with highlighted regions in salmon pink, and it is marked with numbers and roman numerals, further explaining its operational focus.\n\nOverall, the photo suggests a setting in a strategic or control room environment, where the man seems to be an officer or planner involved in logistics or operations monitoring. The elements of the photo work together to evoke a narrative of organization, strategy, and high-level management or control.","title":"Police-Colonel Engineer Ernst Kubista, chief of traffic control, at his desk in the electronic traffic control room","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["556755","551916","551896","551904","551897","552390","546280","547720","552388","552387","551898","552392","556006","542690","547353","556285"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["map","logistic","symbol","table","control","salmon","code","indicator","comb","status"]}
