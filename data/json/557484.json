{"path":"557484.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet somewhat surreal beach scene. In the foreground, several people are enjoying the sun on a sandy beach. There is a group of individuals; one appears to be sitting and wearing a hat, while others are lying down, presumably sunbathing. The central part of the foreground shows a sandy beach, devoid of vegetation, with personal belongings scattered near the beachgoers, suggesting a relaxed day at the beach.\n\nIn the background, dominating the horizon over the ocean, is a large offshore oil rig. Its presence provides a stark industrial contrast to the casual and natural setting of the beach scene. The oil rig is partially obscured by a hazy or misty sky, which could be a result of the weather or possibly haze emanating from the rig itself. The color palette of the scene is dominated by the blues of the ocean and the sky, and the neutral tones of the sand, punctuated by the dark silhouette of the oil rig.\n\nThis juxtaposition of a leisurely beach environment against the backdrop of industrial activity invites reflection on the coexistence of natural landscapes and human industrial pursuits. The composition captures a balance between human relaxation and industrial endeavor, framed within a natural coastal setting.","title":"Sunbathers at Huntington Beach, and an oil platform offshore. Nearby a major housing development is under construction, one of relatively few that have been authorized since the implementation of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in 1973. The commissions, which are charged with determining development along the shoreline, must submit recommendations to the state legislature by January, 1976, recommending guidelines for future shoreline development.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["557510","546393","544272","549220","552990","542890","546375","551959","546219","550937","545162","545963","546402","543089","553772","545081"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["rig","beach","oil","ocean","beachgoer","pursuit","belonging","result","endeavor","balance"]}
