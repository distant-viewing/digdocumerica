{"path":"547905.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat abstract and texturally rich scene focusing on the edge of a body of water. To the right of the image, there's a stretch of dark, moist soil mixed with small stones and pebbles. A portion of this land appears eroded, perhaps by the action of water, revealing different layers of soil and organic material as it intersects the water.\n\nOn the left, the water is mostly calm and exhibits a mix of muted colorsâ€”tones of blue, gray, and a hint of beige or light brown, likely reflections or sediment in the water. The boundary where the land meets the water is blurred and muddled, emphasizing an interplay of earth and water.\n\nThe water itself is scattered with several small, dark particles which could be bits of soil, organic debris, or small aquatic organisms. No significant human activity, objects, or distinct background elements like buildings or structures are visible in the frame. The image conveys a natural, quiet setting with a focus on environmental textures and interfaces.","title":"Oil-blackened shoreline of an industrial inlet of gravesend bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550341","545923","544765","555626","552237","543652","553427","549538","550458","542582","544709","549641","550750","550492","557251","543554"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["soil","water","organism","interface","particle","land","pebble","mix","sediment","intersect"]}
