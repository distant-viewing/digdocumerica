{"path":"551423.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a serene yet slightly neglected natural scene featuring a water body, believed to be a river or stream, flanked by wooded banks with bare trees suggesting a late autumn or early spring timeline. The river gently reflects the overcast sky and some of the trees from the surrounding landscape.\n\nA concrete bridge spans the river in the middle distance, presenting a modern contrast to the otherwise natural environment. The bridge has a simple design with a green-colored side railing visible along its length.\n\nThe right bank of the river, prominently visible in the foreground, shows signs of erosion or land clearing. A large pile of debris and earth is present, including exposed roots and bare soil. Notably, there is also a large, industrial-looking pipe partially buried in the debris, suggesting some form of water management or construction activity.\n\nOn the bank above this dishevelled scene, there are three individuals who appear to be engaged in some sort of observational or monitoring activity. They are dressed casually and seem to be looking out towards the river or perhaps the bridge, possibly evaluating the environment or the impact of the nearby human activities.\n\nThe overall color palette of the image is muted, with earthy browns, dull greens, and pale blues, typical of outdoor conditions under an overcast sky. The environment feels tranquil yet tinged with an undercurrent of human impact, suggested by the infrastructure and disrupted riverbank.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
