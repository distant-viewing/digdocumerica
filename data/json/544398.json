{"path":"544398.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a rural domestic scene set against an early evening sky. The environment primarily consists of dry, sandy ground, with some sparse grassy patches and scattered vegetation.\n\nIn the foreground, two children stand within a fenced area. A young boy in a red jacket and striped pants is positioned left of center, looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. To his right, another child in a colorful, striped sleeveless top and orange pants is turned away from the camera, evidently engaged in hanging or examining white laundry on a clothesline that spans the width of the fence.\n\nBehind these children, the landscape features several modest dwellings. One visible house, centrally positioned, has a simple, two-story structure with a pale blue and white color scheme. Beside the house, a variety of items including water tanks, construction materials, and assorted household goods can be seen, suggesting ongoing construction or maintenance activities.\n\nThe overall setting suggests a blend of residential life with elements of rural, possibly subsistence, living, characterized by practical attire and chores such as laundry. The mountains in the distant background and soft sky hint at the broader rural environment surrounding this homely scene.","title":"New Navajo community, built by Navajo Pine Industry","placename":"Navajo Indian Reservation (Ariz.)","location":"Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona","nn1":["551130","556166","551129","556439","548837","556163","545546","546958","545526","545509","545383","544372","556454","551100","553498","544424"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["child","fence","clothesline","laundry","dwelling","construction","pant","household","house","width"]}
