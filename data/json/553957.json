{"path":"553957.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an older model bus, painted in a light, metallic color. The bus has a large window panel that runs along its length, through which several passengers are visible. The people on the bus appear diverse, with some wearing hats or caps. They look through the windows, engaged with the outside views.\n\nOn the side of the bus, the text \"The Contour Coach\" is visible near the front, followed by the registration number \"PRC 3476\". Below this, \"Nicolaus Island Tours\" is written prominently, suggesting that the bus is used for tourism, likely catering to visitors exploring an island.\n\nThe setting looks like a sunny day, evidenced by the clear blue skies and white fluffy clouds in the background. The lighting suggests it could be midday, due to the bright and vivid color saturation. The bus itself has a door slightly hidden from view on the far left, indicating that the bus might be at a stop, possibly picking up or dropping off passengers.","title":"A tour of the island","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["555568","552773","555978","546604","547814","546655","556748","556797","556743","556745","543513","556793","549921","556746","549891","556795"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bus","passenger","diverse","tourism","cate","registration","drop","pick","explore","stop"]}
