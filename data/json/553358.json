{"path":"553358.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a natural scene featuring a variety of plants nestled among rugged rocks. The focal point is a cluster of lush, green ferns displaying detailed, delicate fronds. Accompanying the ferns, slightly in the shadows, are smaller plants with leaves that appear to be darker and more rounded. The rocks themselves are irregularly shaped and have a rough, textured surface, covered in places by a light moss or lichen, contributing to a sense of age and natural weathering.\n\nThe composition of the photo emphasizes a contrast between the soft, organic forms of the plants and the hard, enduring quality of the stones. The lighting in the image is soft, with shadows that suggest an overcast day or a shaded environment, likely in a forest or mountainous area. The background is softly focused, allowing the viewer's attention to remain on the textures and forms of the ferns and the rocks, enhancing the intimate feel of the scene.","title":"Some of the rare ferns found on the shore of the nissitisset river, a branch of the Nashua, near the town of pepperell","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["553589","555191","554996","555192","553590","555049","554743","555026","547635","554993","554572","555183","555027","554596","555093","545285"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["fern","rock","plant","shap","fronds","lichen","endure","shaded","weathering","form"]}
