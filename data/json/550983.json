{"path":"550983.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene dominated by large plumes of smoke rising into the sky. The sky is almost obscured by thick, billowing smoke that appears white and gray against the background. In the foreground, there is a silhouette of industrial buildings, which appear dark and almost shadow-like due to the backlighting caused by the smoke. Multiple structures with various angled roofs and visible chimneys or vents suggest these are factories or processing plants.\n\nAlso noticeable in the foreground are railway tracks, which meander toward the factories, indicative of industrial logistics and transport. A utility pole stands prominently on the left side, with wires stretching across the scene, further emphasizing the industrial setting. The background includes a faint hint of greenery atop the hills, slightly visible through the haze, adding a natural element to the otherwise predominantly industrial landscape.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is somewhat ominous, highlighted by the dark tones, the vast smoke clouds, and the industrial backdrop. The photo likely intends to showcase environmental impact, industrial activity, or a specific event related to the factories shown.","title":"Emission from the Union Carbide ferro Alloy plant darkens the sky at Alloy, WV.","placename":"Charleston (W.
