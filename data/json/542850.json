{"path":"542850.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a heavily scarred landscape following deforestation or logging activities. The central focal point is a thick, muddy track that appears deeply grooved and furrowed by the passage of heavy machinery, suggesting recent activity in the area. The track is saturated with water, creating a slick, reflective surface that catches the reddish-brown color of the mud.\n\nSurrounding this muddy track are piles of debris, mainly consisting of chopped wood, branches, and tree stumps. This suggests that trees have been recently cut down and removed, leaving behind remnants scattered haphazardly around the area. The soil around the track is disturbed and loose, indicating significant disruption to the terrain.\n\nIn the foreground, the mud and debris are more pronounced with small puddles of water accumulating in the uneven ground, highlighting the environmental impact of the logging. Towards the edges of the frame, the natural vegetation appears dense and dark, providing a stark contrast to the devastated area. The lighting in the photograph is dim, possibly indicating an overcast sky, which casts an overall somber tone to the scene.\n\nThis image effectively captures the environmental damage and transformation brought about by intense industrial activity, specifically logging, and the resultant landscape alteration. It serves as a visual commentary on the impacts of human economic activities on natural forests.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542827","542829","542949","555092","555208","553468","555104","546060","555150","555221","555136","555094","550354","542948","542828","545138"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["track","mud","deforestation","transformation","alteration","impact","commentary","disruption","stump","puddle"]}
