{"path":"546200.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The image depicts a natural forest scene featuring a small, dark body of water, possibly a pond or bog, surrounded by dense greenery and tall pine trees. The water body is encircled with various types of vegetation including shrubs, ferns, and fallen tree branches, suggestive of a tranquil, undisturbed setting. The reflection of the trees can be seen on the surface of the water, enhancing the peaceful atmosphere of the scene.\n\nIn the background, the sky is visible with patches of clouds, and the tall, slender trunks of the pine trees stretch upwards, dominating the upper part of the image. These trees appear well-spaced, suggesting a managed or naturally sparse forest area.\n\nOn the left side of the image, partially obscured by the foliage, there appears to be a red vehicle, which suggests human activity nearby, perhaps related to forestry or conservation work. The presence of the vehicle provides a hint of human presence or intervention in an otherwise natural landscape. The overall composition of the photograph, with the focus on both the serene water feature and the towering trees, gives a sense of the scale and beauty of this forest environment.","title":"Kimball oil field pool","placename":"Palestine (Tex.)","location":"Palestine, Texas","nn1":["553410","554525","553465","553075","543700","554529","547011","555728","554526","543611","554527","554606","556931","555229","552141","551349"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["forest","tree","fern","forestry","intervention","pine","conservation","water","pond","vehicle"]}
