{"path":"550568.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a distinct, rugged landscape contrasted by dense forestry and a visible man-made feature. The central focus is a large, open pit excavation site, characterized by its terraced, concentric circular pattern indicating ongoing or past mining activity. The pit exhibits varying color layers, likely representing different soil and mineral compositions; warm-toned earthy browns and vibrant rust hues suggest iron-rich soils.\n\nSurrounding the excavation site is a dense, dark green coniferous forest, creating a stark natural border and offering a vivid display of undisturbed wilderness in juxtaposition to the disrupted terrain of the pit. Towards the right side of the image, a wide, unpaved road, light brown in color, cuts through the trees and runs parallel across the scene. This road appears to be the main access route to and from the mining site, possibly used for the transportation of materials and equipment.\n\nThere are no visible people or animals in the scene, highlighting the isolation and possibly temporary abandonment of the area, maybe due to the photographic perspective or the nature of the site usage. The overall composition captures the impact of industrial activity within a seemingly remote, natural environment, illustrating the intersection of human enterprise and the natural world.","title":"A state of Alaska highway department gravel pit located a mile east of the pipeline route.
