{"path":"554012.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant rural scene dominated by a sprawling pineapple field. The image features an individual riding a horse, moving through dense rows of pineapple plants which display a lush, dark green color. The terrain is flat, suggesting a vast agricultural landscape.\n\nIn the background, rolling hills subtly line the horizon. These hills are partly shaded, adding a sense of depth to the landscape, while open fields with different shades of brown and green stretch across the mid and back sections of the image. The lighting of the photograph is warm and appears to be taken during sunrise or sunset, as indicated by the soft golden hues bathing the hillsides and highlighting sections of the field.\n\nThe sky is not visible in the image, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the agricultural activities and the natural terrain. Overall, the composition of the photograph, with the rider crossing the field, encapsulates a moment of rural life and highlights a serene, productive environment typical of agricultural settings.","title":"With pineapple fields as his arena, henri aki takes his horse for a late afternoon training session near Lanai city.
