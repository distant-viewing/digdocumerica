{"path":"555586.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a large industrial scene, likely a mining operation. Central to the image is a towering, massive crane or excavating machine painted red and white. The structure has a very tall and thick main body with legs that appear to support its enormous weight. Suspended from the top of the structure are multiple heavy-duty cables, from which a series of industrial buckets hang. These buckets are being used to transport material, possibly ore or soil, and are captured in various positions in their journey up or down.\n\nThe background is somewhat obscured by the haze, but it appears to be an open landscape suggesting a large-scale mining site. The foreground shows a mound of earth, indicating recent or ongoing excavation activity. No human figures are visible, emphasizing the scale and the mechanical nature of the operation. The machine dominates the view, projecting an image of powerful industrial capability.","title":"Head of the giant \"Silver Spade\" coal shovel owned by the Hanna Coal Company dwarfs some trees as the machine scoops coal from a trench.","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["545887","554770","554826","555593","544134","555644","545831","544157","552418","545883","555631","555633","547583","544165","548775","553827"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["bucket","machine","mining","ore","capability","weight","scale","operation","journey","duty"]}
