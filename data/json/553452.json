{"path":"553452.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a winding river in a natural landscape. The river cuts through a terrain which appears white or sandy, creating a stark contrast against the lush, dark green foliage of the surrounding trees. There are patches of foliage around the bends of the river, interspersed with exposed ground. \n\nFrom this vantage point, the landscape is largely untouched by human activity, providing a serene view of the natural world. The textures visible in the photograph, such as the rough surface of the terrain along the riverbank and the dense canopy of the trees, add to the richness of the scene. The lighting, possibly subdued due to cloud cover or time of day, casts gentle shadows and enhances the moody, tranquil atmosphere.","title":"Nashua river below groton","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550622","550616","550527","550542","550625","550571","542701","549456","552838","542653","542909","550562","550531","550885","544861","550844"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","richness","foliage","world","moody","terrain","textur","win","riverbank","vantage"]}
