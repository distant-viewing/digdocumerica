{"path":"548170.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a Texaco gas station, likely from the 1970s given the style of the vehicles and signage. Prominently featured in the image is a large sign that reads, \"OUR STATION HOURS ARE REDUCED DUE TO GAS SHORTAGE SORRY.\" This message references a historical period of fuel shortages that affected many countries.\n\nThe Texaco branding is visible through a large, circular logo and the name displayed on top of a tall sign post, also showing the iconic Texaco star in red and white. Just beneath the star, an additional sign highlights different gasoline options, such as \"Fire Chief\" and \"Sky Chief,\" with prices displayed.\n\nVisible in the foreground are several cars typical of the period's design, with curved bodies and prominent front grills. The cars are in motion, suggesting a busy period either entering or exiting the fuel station.\n\nOn the bottom right, a street sign is partially visible, revealing the intersection of \"SW FINWOOD RD\" and \"BOONES FERRY RD.\" In the background, there are trees, adding a somewhat suburban feel to the setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its dynamic range of colors and busy atmosphere, captures a moment of daily life altered by an economic energy crisis affecting the society of the time.","title":"One of many service stations in the Portland area carrying signs reflecting the gasoline shortage","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555452","548047","555484","555489","555465","548053","548174","555459","555415","555405","548173","555498","555485","555486","548049","555473"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["period","fuel","station","star","gas","sign","crisis","shortage","option","gasoline"]}
