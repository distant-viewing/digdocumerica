{"path":"543016.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural landscape, primarily dominated by the silhouette of a tall conifer tree, possibly a pine or fir, set against a backdrop of a shimmering sea under a subtly illuminated sky. The central tree is densely branched, its outline crisp against the dusk light, creating a striking contrast.\n\nThe sea in the background captures the encroaching evening light, scattering it across its surface, creating a textured appearance of the water with varying shades from darker blues to lighter, almost silvery areas. Above the horizon, there is a faint indication of clouds, which add depth and layers to the composition, enhancing the tranquil and contemplative mood of the scene.\n\nThe photograph's ambiance is calm and reflective, with the natural elements combining to evoke a sense of solitary beauty and peaceful isolation. The lighting, likely captured during late evening or early morning, contributes to the dramatic and moody quality of the image. The scene is devoid of any human activity or additional objects, focusing solely on the interplay of natural elements and light.","title":"Coastal scene","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555119","542927","542849","543145","554403","552142","547705","554731","557000","547044","554073","553593","547546","556473","543621","550646"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["evening","fir","sea","encroach","indication","conifer","pine","combine","light","outline"]}
