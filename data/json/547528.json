{"path":"547528.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely from a factory or manufacturing site. In the foreground, we see railroad tracks embedded in a surface covered with dirt and debris, indicative of frequent heavy use. The tracks lead towards and converge in the distance at a central point in the image.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo features several elements associated with industry, including a small red crane on the left and various types of heavy machinery and metal structures, possibly used for loading or processing materials. There are also what appear to be industrial bins or containers placed sporadically throughout.\n\nIn the background, the focal point is a large building that seems to be a central facility at the site. It is a rectangular, multi-story structure with large windows and external piping or framing. To the sides and above the building, there are additional industrial elements like tall storage silos and a crane structure, emphasizing the operational nature of the site.\n\nThe overall scene suggests a well-used, functional industrial setting, possibly involved in manufacturing or processing commodities. The sky appears clear, suggesting a dry or favorable weather condition which also casts clear shadows, adding to the depth of the scene. No people are visible in this photograph, which underscores the focus on the structures and machinery of the site.","title":"State pier--600 feet over Narragansett bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["556382","545445","554632","545992","545503","555564","555779","556853","554435","556873","547010","543174","547140","556852","546085","557385"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["site","manufacturing","crane","track","bin","machinery","embed","piping","converge","loading"]}
