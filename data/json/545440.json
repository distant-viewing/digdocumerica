{"path":"545440.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph captures a scene in front of \"Lucy's Grocery,\" a small, typical corner store featuring a variety of advertising signs, including those for Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Royal Crown Cola. The building itself has a rustic charm with dark wooden siding and a white trimmed awning that shades the storefront. The name \"Lucy's\" is displayed prominently at the top of the building, along with the Coca-Cola and Pepsi logos, signaling the sale of popular soft drinks.\n\nIn front of the store, on a wooden sidewalk, stands a group of five children, posing playfully for the photograph. They are all dressed in casual, colorful 1970s style clothing, which varies from bright shirts and shorts to striped pants and dresses. One of the children, wearing yellow knee-high socks, a green top, and denim shorts, stands out due to her cheerful, energetic pose. Another child holds a bag and a packaged item, possibly snacks or drinks obtained from the store.\n\nThe environment around the store suggests a sunny day, which adds liveliness to the scene. The worn wooden structure and the signage of the store offer a glimpse into a community-focused setting, where such small corner stores serve as local hubs. The image exudes a sense of day-to-day life in a close-knit neighborhood, possibly capturing a moment of youthful camaraderie and a snapshot of local commerce in a bygone era.","title":"Neighborhood store","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["553097","552411","556214","547805","556265","551132","550137","551291","556221","547751","556223","557382","546873","554036","554868","552518"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["store","drink","child","corner","short","liveliness","snack","awning","sock","camaraderie"]}
