{"path":"545759.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged, outdoor scene dominated by sweeping, textured rock formations. The rocks exhibit a wide range of earthy tones, primarily reddish-brown, with layered, undulating patterns that create a dynamic visual texture throughout the image.\n\nIn the center of the image, a person is walking along the natural rock pathway. They are equipped with a backpack, dressed in cool weather hiking gear, and appear to be navigating or exploring the terrain. The person emphasizes the scale and expanse of the rock formations surrounding them.\n\nThe surroundings are devoid of vegetation, underlining the arid, desert-like environment. The sky is overcast, spreading a diffuse light that enriches the colors of the rock formations.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its winding path leading through towering rock walls, and the solitary figure of the hiker, evokes a sense of adventure and isolation in a vast natural landscape.","title":"A hiker in the maze, a remote and rugged region in the heart of the canyonlands.  In these wild sections there are no trails, and the explorer must rely on map and compass.  Previous experience is necessary; water is scarce, the terrain unforgiving and help is sometimes days away.  But the rewards are great, and many people feel that this is the only way to truly experience the canyonlands","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545571","545762","544902","544898","544903","545697","544341","543838","545700","543846","545758","544917","545592","554507","545772","545766"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["rock","formation","undulating","hiker","layered","hike","backpack","underlin","explore","enrich"]}
