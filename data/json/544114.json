{"path":"544114.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts a natural scenery where two deer are evident in a forested area. The terrain is hilly and covered with a mix of green grass and dried patches, hinting at a transitional period possibly between summer and fall. Both deer are in the middle of grazing on the open grassy expanse. They are surrounded by dense, tall conifer trees that provide a dark green backdrop contrasting against the lighter, sunlit patches of the meadow.\n\nThe light appears to be coming from a direction that casts some shadows from the trees across the meadow, indicating either early morning or late afternoon. The setting promotes a feeling of tranquility and untouched wilderness, ideal for observing wildlife in their natural habitat. The composition of the photo places the deer centrally, making them the focal point against the vastness of the forested landscape.","title":"Deer in Kaibab National Forest, near the north rim of GRand Canyon","placename":"Kaibab National Forest (Ariz.)","location":"Kaibab National Forest, Arizona","nn1":["543326","553808","542963","542955","558368","545902","546088","544623","546198","544571","549219","544914","543369","546163","546232","544916"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","meadow","promote","graze","ideal","dry","come","patch","habitat","wildlife"]}
