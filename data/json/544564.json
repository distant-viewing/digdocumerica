{"path":"544564.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph of a rural or semi-arid landscape that features a distinctive geometric pattern of roads and plots. The terrain underneath shows a varied texture with patches of both darker and lighter areas, suggesting variations in vegetation, soil, or land use.\n\nThe landscape is divided into a grid by straight roads, forming large square and rectangular plots. In the bottom center of the image, there is a cluster of small white and grey structures which could be residential or farm buildings, surrounded by a few trees that provide a stark contrast to the relatively barren surroundings.\n\nA main road runs vertically through the image, passing through the cluster of buildings, indicating it might be the primary access road for the area. There are no visible vehicles or people, suggesting low activity or sparse population.\n\nThe vast, open fields with minimal buildings imply that the area may be used for agriculture, albeit with potential challenges due to the arid environment. The back of the image blends towards a seamless horizon, with no prominent natural or man-made features visible, stressing the expansive and uninterrupted nature of the landscape.","title":"\"suburban acres\" housing project is under water on the edge of the Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["554164","555888","554166","553047","542710","545842","542517","555863","553125","553694","553059","548908","549098","555873","558414","557517"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["plot","road","potential","population","stress","cluster","square","pass","challenge","agriculture"]}
