{"path":"554893.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a sheep shearing shed. A man is actively engaged in shearing a sheep. He is seated on a wooden platform, surrounded by chunks of wool, which appear to have been sheared off recently. The man, who has curly hair and is dressed in a light blue short-sleeve shirt and khaki pants, focuses intently on his task, using shearing clippers in his hands.\n\nBehind him is a pen filled with sheep, densely packed, likely waiting their turn for shearing. The shed's interior is rustic, with wooden structures and a dimly lit ambiance, suggesting an early day or cloudy weather outside. The floor of the shed is littered with fluffy wool, and various shearing tools and supplies are visible around the man. To his left, a partial view of another individual (only the arm is visible), suggests that there are more people working or assisting in the shed. The scene is a vivid depiction of rural agricultural activity, specifically related to livestock management and wool production.","title":"Sheep being sheared on a ranch near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["554884","554892","544391","554883","554881","552568","554894","547396","554886","551657","554880","554882","543690","554890","552573","554888"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["wool","shed","sheep","chunk","khaki","pen","livestock","supply","assist","depiction"]}
