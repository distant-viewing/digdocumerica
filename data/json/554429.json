{"path":"554429.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph displays a detailed scene set within an industrial environment, likely a lumber mill or a woodworking facility. The central focus of the image is on a large mechanical apparatus used for processing wood. At the forefront, we see a conveyor system equipped with multiple rollers, which appears to be transporting a long wooden plank. This plank exhibits freshly cut surfaces, suggesting that it has recently been split or milled.\n\nProminent in the image is an array of mechanical components such as gears, chains, and belts, intricately interconnected to form the operational machinery. These components are mostly metallic and look utilitarian, emphasizing the industrial nature of the equipment.\n\nThe setting is dimly lit, cast with shadows which create a somewhat gritty and worn atmosphere typical of manufacturing environments. The background of the photo is cluttered with additional machinery and structural elements that support the operation, such as steel beams and additional conveyor parts.\n\nAltogether, the photograph captures the mechanical complexity and industrial vigor of a facility dedicated to wood processing, emphasizing both the scale and functionality of the machinery used in such environments.","title":"At the litchfield paper company mill near Tupper Lake, logs that have been stripped, then squared into four-by-fours, are cut into boards","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554428","554430","554431","556388","544026","543158","554432","558373","547964","557945","544048","543997","546757","546923","546255","544007"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["conveyor","mill","machinery","plank","component","roller","wood","manufacture","lumber","split"]}
