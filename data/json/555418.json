{"path":"555418.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a striking night view of a cityscape characterized by its illuminated buildings and bustling traffic. In the foreground, a highway with multiple lanes exhibits the dynamic trails of headlights and tail lights, created from long exposure; these light streaks indicate fast-moving vehicles, imparting a sense of urban energy.\n\nDominating the central part of the image are tall urban structures. Two prominent skyscrapers stand out: one on the left with a slender, towering form accentuated by vertical lighting, giving it a stark and modern aesthetic. The other skyscraper, to the right, has a more solid and rectilinear shape, uniformly lit which highlights its expansive surface.\n\nThe city's background is a mix of moderately lit mid-rise buildings that create a layered effect, adding depth to the view. The topography appears to slope upwards away from these larger buildings, with scattered lights suggesting residential or commercial areas nestled on these elevations.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of movement and stability, contrasting the fleeting nature of the traffic with the enduring presence of architectural structures, all enveloped in the nocturnal ambiance of the city.","title":"Downtown core area of Portland, after 7 p.m. on November 2, 1973, during the state's energy crisis with few commercial and neon lighting displays.
