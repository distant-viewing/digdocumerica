{"path":"551861.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a silhouette of a person handling grape clusters next to a water sprinkling truck. The person is dressed in a formal way, wearing a jacket, a light-colored shirt, and a necktie. He appears to be either examining or selecting grapes from a bunch that he is holding in his right hand, while holding another object in his left hand.\n\nThe scene takes place outdoors, possibly on a street or in a paved area, where a water truck is spraying the ground, creating a large fan of water that adds a dynamic background element. The sunlight interacts with the sprayed water, giving parts of the image a bright, almost ethereal glow. The background is mostly subdued with some elements like trees vaguely visible, enhancing the focus on the central figure and the water spray. The overall mood conveyed is one that combines everyday tasks with a visually dramatic and somewhat mysterious setting.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussg√§ngerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people. It is totally traffic free. Not even bicycle riding is permitted. At the western end of the mall, a once busy traffic circle has been replaced by a fountain. This young man uses it to wash grapes.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["542654","542534","549036","543777","544246","557520","543792","543324","544832","542505","544371","549056","542535","543781","542502","554047"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["spray","select","truck","fan","sprinkle","water","person","hand","hold","examine"]}
