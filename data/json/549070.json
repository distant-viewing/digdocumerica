{"path":"549070.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a red fire hydrant prominently centered and positioned in the foreground against a vibrant green grassy area. The hydrant is painted a highly visible red, typical of many fire hydrants to ensure high visibility. It has inscriptions and outlines distinctively embossed on its cap and body, suggesting functional and warning specifications.\n\nIn the background, to the left, there is a dark-colored trash bin placed on the grass, further adding to the urban setting of the scene. The overall background exhibits a slightly sloped landscape with a small trench or ditch visible beyond the grassy area, suggesting some erosion or landscaping function. Trees surround the setting, lending a natural and slightly untamed feel to the environment.\n\nThe scene is outdoors during daylight, and the lighting seems to create a soft shadow on the grass from the fire hydrant, hinting that the image was taken on a day with some cloud cover or during a time when the sun was not at its peak.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses the viewer on the vibrant and stark contrast between the manufactured red of the fire hydrant and the natural green of the grass, along with a subtle juxtaposition with other elements of typical urban planning such as the trash bin.","title":"Water hydrant on Lake Havasu City golf course","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["554124","557457","549841","549838","548213","549834","552134","551644","557142","557733","551705","551490","544519","556177","543614","552741"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["hydrant","fire","bin","trash","grass","inscription","trench","landscaping","planning","function"]}
