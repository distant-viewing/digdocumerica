{"path":"547612.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image captures a serene beach scene. In the foreground, there is a section of sandy beach covered with sparse vegetation, possibly sea grasses, which has a somewhat tangled appearance. The sand appears pale and fine-textured, marked with darker areas that might be wet sand or shadows.\n\nThe middle ground features an individual standing on the beach, facing away from the viewpoint towards the ocean. The person, appearing relatively small against the vastness of the beach and the ocean, is dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, suggesting a casual outfit suitable for the beach setting.\n\nBeyond the figure, the beach opens up to the expansive ocean. The sea shows soft waves hitting the shore, generating foam. The ocean's color transitions from a darker blue farther out to lighter blue as it approaches the shore, indicating shallower waters. The overall lighting suggests a bright sunny day without noticeable cloud cover, enhancing the vivid blue of the ocean and the paleness of the sandy beach.\n\nThe upper part of the photograph shows the horizon where the sky meets the sea, underscoring the vastness and calmness of the scene. This composition, with its natural palette and tranquil setting, evokes a sense of peaceful solitude.","title":"On the dunes","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["547596","545280","547600","547599","548757","546953","547607","543287","547608","543089","546982","543493","548706","543303","548220","548280"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","ocean","sea","blue","vastness","sand","shore","hit","generate","calmness"]}
