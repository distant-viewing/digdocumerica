{"path":"552582.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and vast landscape, characterized by a broad valley nestled between two hills. The hills themselves possess rugged textures, with patches of trees and shrubs clinging to their slopes, highlighting a semi-arid environment. The valley floor appears lush in comparison, peppered with green grass and a variety of bushes, suggesting a presence of water or a wetter microclimate in this area.\n\nIn the distance, the valley gently meanders and narrows, guided on either side by the rising hills, which create a natural V-shape leading the viewer's eye into the horizon. The sky above is a saturated, deep blue, indicating clear weather and possibly a time of day close to late afternoon based on the lighting and the long shadows cast across parts of the valley floor.\n\nDespite the presence of the vivid natural landscape, the photograph does not include any visible human activity or man-made structures, reinforcing a sense of solitude and untouched natural beauty. This absence of human elements could imply the location's remoteness or preservation as a natural area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, with its emphasis on broad, sweeping landscapes and clear demarcation between the lush valley floor and the barren hills, exudes a tranquil and almost untouched quality, inviting contemplation of natural landscapes and their quiet grandeur.","title":"Looking up the middle fork of stuart gulch, part of reuben oldland's pasture.
