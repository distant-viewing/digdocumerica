{"path":"545838.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a large body of water dotted with numerous oil drilling platforms and rigs. The platforms vary in size; some are large, heavily structured with visible machinery and infrastructure, while others are smaller, simpler rigs. Many of the rigs have cranes and other operational equipment visible. There is no visible land in the photo, suggesting the rigs are located offshore.\n\nThe water appears calm, reflecting a semi-dark, possibly overcast sky. There's no activity visible such as boats in motion or workers, giving the scene a quiet and still impression. The photo appears to be taken from a high vantage point, possibly from another rig or an aircraft.\n\nThe water and the rigs offer a monotone palette, mostly in shades of blue and gray, enhancing the industrial feel of the scene. The distribution of rigs across the water portrays a well-developed oil extraction area. The presence of numerous pilings in the water suggests that there are either under-construction rigs or remnants of old infrastructures.","title":"Off-shore oil wells in Galveston Bay","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["545834","544512","552990","544272","544511","552836","547958","551977","546245","557484","555775","549978","547668","552131","555634","545963"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["rig","oil","platform","piling","water","distribution","infrastructure","extraction","aircraft","remnant"]}
