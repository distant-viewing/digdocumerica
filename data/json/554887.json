{"path":"554887.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene featuring a flock of sheep congregated under and around large, leafy trees. The setting appears to be a farm or pasture, as indicated by the fenced areas and the presence of rural structures such as a wood-slat fence and a corrugated metal shed or barn in the background. The ground is covered with stones and fallen leaves, suggesting an outdoor countryside environment.\n\nIn the background, a person can be seen standing near the wooden fence, possibly overseeing the flock or preparing to attend to the sheep. The trees provide a canopy of shade, creating a dappled lighting effect across the scene. The overall atmosphere is serene and pastoral, evoking a sense of quiet rural life. The composition of the photograph, with the trees framing the scene and the scattered flock beneath, draws attention to the interaction between agricultural activity and the natural environment.","title":"Sheep on a ranch in the Leakey, Texas, area are held in pens for shearing, then are returned to pasture or sent for slaughter near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554928","554779","555820","544391","552556","557747","552555","544384","544933","554935","554894","554932","543269","554883","554880","554882"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["flock","sheep","fence","congregate","slat","pasture","countryside","oversee","attend","barn"]}
