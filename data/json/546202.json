{"path":"546202.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph shows a close-up view of a patch of shallow water with a rocky and algae-covered surface. The image captures the intricate details of varying textures and colors. The water appears clear and flows gently over a bed covered with rocks, pebbles, and patches of green and brown algae. The sunlight reflects off the water's surface, creating shimmering effects and enhancing the visibility of the underwater elements. There is no visible wildlife or human activity; the focus is solely on the natural aquatic environment. The photograph likely aims to depict the serene and detailed aspects of a natural water habitat, possibly in a stream or shallow river.","title":"Beads of solidified pollution in the lake which surrounds the eastman kodak plant","placename":"Longview (Tex.)","location":"Longview, Texas","nn1":["546875","543555","542582","543185","557251","543554","555077","550726","555626","543172","543183","552917","544765","550341","542583","546171"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["algae","pebble","aim","bed","water","patch","habitat","wildlife","stream","visibility"]}
