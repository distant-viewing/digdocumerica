{"path":"548236.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph is a close-up portrait of an older man, capturing a thoughtful and candid expression. The man is wearing a red and black plaid hat, which appears to be a baseball cap style, and it sits snugly on his head. He is also wearing a red and black flannel jacket over a green sweater, suggesting a layered attire commonly used in cooler weather. The man has noticeable wrinkles and character lines on his face, indicating age and experience. His expression is contemplative and carries a slight smile, giving a friendly and approachable look.\n\nThe background is blurred, allowing the subject to stand clearly in focus, which draws the viewer's attention directly to his expression and attire. The soft, out-of-focus background suggests a natural, outdoor setting with subdued colors, complementing the overall tone of the portrait.\n\nOverall, the composition and focus on the man's facial features and attire contribute to a portrait that feels intimate and personal, providing a glimpse into the character and lifestyle of the subject.","title":"Worker with the Rockport Public Works Department","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["548226","542613","547282","547179","548218","548251","552103","554857","554858","553091","553605","548302","549120","548224","556133","554915"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["portrait","character","expression","flannel","attire","subject","wrinkle","man","baseball","lifestyle"]}
