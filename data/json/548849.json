{"path":"548849.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a close-up of a railway crossing sign and, likely, an attached signal component. The sign is a traditional X-shaped (diagonal cross) railroad sign, prominently featuring the words \"RAILROAD CROSSING\" in all caps punched out to create a dot matrix effect, enhancing visibility and texture. Each arm of the cross features one of the words. The sign appears to be mounted on a metal pole.\n\nAttached below the sign, there are two circular-shaped bells, positioned side by side. These bells are typically used to alert motorists and pedestrians of an oncoming train with their ringing. The bells are black and gritty, perhaps indicating age or exposure to environmental elements. Between and slightly above the bells, there is a mechanical setup, possibly part of the bell and signal mechanism. The fixture and the bells have a utilitarian look, covered in what looks like a tough, wear-resistant coating.\n\nIn the background, the image blurs slightly, focusing attention on the sign and bells. The background hints at a clear blue sky, suggesting that the photograph was taken during daytime under bright conditions.","title":"Railroad crossing signal is covered with white dust from the gypsum plant at Plaster City.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548848","547944","558258","556090","544681","550010","547940","556126","556128","556783","557881","555988","558020","555927","544715","550200"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["bell","signal","sign","crossing","cross","word","dot","fixture","mechanism","railroad"]}
