{"path":"553399.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene, featuring a large paper mill named \"Parchment Paper Company.\" The main building in the image is an expansive multi-story brick structure with many windows and includes several vertical elements like chimneys and pipes, characteristic of industrial manufacturing facilities of its time.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a body of water, possibly a pond, that reflects the image of the paper mill, doubling its visual presence in the photo. Along the edge of the water, some scrub vegetation and dirt can be seen, depicting a somewhat neglected or natural industrial boundary.\n\nThe sky above is mostly clear with a few clouds, suggesting it might be a sunny day. This outdoor natural lighting enhances the details of the building and its architectural features. The reflection in the water adds a serene yet somewhat somber tone to the otherwise industrial scene, inviting contemplation on nature versus industry.","title":"The Fitchburg Paper Company on the Nashua River.
