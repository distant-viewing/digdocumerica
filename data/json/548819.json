{"path":"548819.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures an aerial view of a large, cluttered salvage yard. The area is densely packed with numerous disassembled vehicles and parts scattered throughout. Various automobiles and components like engines, doors, and chassis can be seen, with some parts stacked or laid out in rows. The vehicles and parts are in various states of dismantlement, and the colors range from rusted metallic tones to patches of remaining paintâ€”reds, blues, whites, and greens.\n\nThe salvage yard is not uniformly organized but follows a loose arrangement where similar items are grouped together in sections. The expanse is bordered by a straight road on one side, hinting at accessibility for transport.\n\nThe surroundings beyond the salvage yard are not densely built-up, suggesting a location that is not immediately adjacent to an urban center. The overall impression is of a busy, somewhat chaotic industrial space dedicated to the storage and recycling of automotive parts.","title":"Auto dump at henderson","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["551996","546268","553004","549023","552999","542656","545340","547054","554335","546267","545303","542590","554320","547777","546249","543166"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["salvage","yard","disassemble","chassis","part","accessibility","recycling","dedicate","engine","automobile"]}
