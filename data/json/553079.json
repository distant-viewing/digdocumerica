{"path":"553079.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil scene set during sunset. The main elements include the sun which is seen setting behind a mountain ridge. The upper part of the image shows the sun partially obscured by the silhouetted outline of the mountains, creating a dramatic and soothing background filled with shades of yellow and orange, tapering into darker tones at the edges.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a large expanse of still water that reflects the silhouette of what appears to be an alligator. The alligator's reflection extends across the water, contributing to a feeling of calm and quiet in the scene. The water and its reflections play a significant role in enhancing the serene and almost monochromatic yellow-orange palette of the sunset.\n\nThe silhouette, simple color scheme, and stillness of the water combine to give the image a peaceful mood, emphasizing the beauty and tranquility of the natural world. The photograph is void of any human presence, focusing solely on the natural elements and their interplay at this tranquil time of day.","title":"Havasu Lake National Wildlife Refuge.
