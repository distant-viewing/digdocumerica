{"path":"550335.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This image portrays an aerial view of an industrial setting by a river. The scene is dominated by a large factory complex that features multiple buildings with flat roofs. The buildings are primarily rectangular, made of various materials, predominantly metal and brick. Most notable are several tall smokestacks from which white and gray smoke billows into the sky, suggesting heavy industrial activity.\n\nTo the left of the factory, there is a dam with water flowing over it, creating a white, foamy line as the river continues downwards. The area surrounding the industrial site is a mix of nature and urban development. There are patches of green forested areas close to the water, contrasting with the industrial site.\n\nOn the right side of the factory, there is a small community with residential houses, arranged in neat rows, featuring roads and green spaces. The presence of the large industrial complex juxtaposed with the residential area and natural landscape highlights a scene where industrial, residential, and natural environments coexist.\n\nLikely, this industrial plant is related to paper milling or a similar processing industry, considering its proximity to water and the nature of its buildings and smokestacks. The image captures a moment in the daily operations of the factory, emphasizing the scale and environmental impact of the industry.","title":"Georgia pacific paper plant on the st.
