{"path":"555578.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph showcases an elaborate Victorian-style house with a distinct architectural design. The house is primarily painted in light colors, likely white, with contrasting trims. The roof seems to be shingled with a mix of darker and lighter shakes, which present a somewhat weathered look. This detailed structure exhibits several defining features typical of the Victorian era, including a steeply pitched roof, ornate gables, a turret with a conical roof, and a spacious wrap-around porch with decorative railings and columns.\n\nA focal point of the design is the turret, which adds a rounded, dynamic element to the otherwise angular architecture. The turret and other parts of the house feature intricately patterned trim work, creating appealing visual textures that demonstrate the craftsmanship of the period. Each window is framed with embellishments and ledges, enhancing the overall aesthetic.\n\nThe house is surrounded by a well-manicured lawn, dotted with shrubbery and a variety of flowers, particularly red blooms concentrated toward the front. Large, mature trees can be seen in the background, suggesting that the house is located in an established, lush neighborhood. On the left side of the photograph, a smaller building, possibly a garage or shed, is partially visible. This structure shares similar stylistic elements with the main house, maintaining a cohesive look on the property.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the beauty and intricate detailing typical of Victorian architecture, set against a vibrant, green backdrop that accentuates the houseâ€™s charm and grandeur.","title":"One of the many beautifully maintained homes built in the earlier 1900's","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["548666","555579","557069","542816","558159","558148","557077","558150","548663","557072","542967","558156","557092","558160","557067","557071"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["turret","house","trim","roof","embellishment","gable","craftsmanship","ledge","shingle","architecture"]}
