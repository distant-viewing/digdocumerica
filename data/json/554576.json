{"path":"554576.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of delicate white flowers sitting on a small branching stem. These flowers are small, with multiple petals radiating from the center. They are at various stages of bloom, some as tight buds and others fully opened. The blooms are surrounded by lush green leaves, which appear to be thick and ovate with a smooth texture and veiny patterns. A blurred background suggests a similarly vegetated environment, enhancing the focus on the sharp detail of the pale flowers and green foliage in the foreground. The overall mood of the image is serene, emphasizing the natural beauty and intricate details of plants.","title":"False lily of the valley (Unifolium canadensis), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545720","545726","554587","545695","554574","553368","553366","547642","554575","557618","555034","554595","543597","544875","554590","555106"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","bloom","bud","stem","petal","detail","stage","leave","other","foliage"]}
