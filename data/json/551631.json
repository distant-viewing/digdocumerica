{"path":"551631.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a road construction scene in an urban setting. In the foreground, there is an open segment of the roadway where construction is ongoing. A large heap of dirt piled beside the hole suggests excavation work. A red flatbed truck, marked \"ACE SCAFFOLDS,\" is parked near the excavation site, equipped with construction machinery.\n\nTwo construction vehicles are visibly involved in the operation. One appears to be a backhoe loader, actively engaged in digging or moving earth, manned by an operator visible in the cabin. The backhoe's extended arm and bucket are positioned over the soil mound, indicating recent or ongoing activity. Another construction vehicle stands idle beside the truck.\n\nTwo men are standing near the excavation, observing or discussing the work; both are facing towards the construction vehicles and away from the camera. Their presence suggests they might be supervisors or workers assessing the progress or planning next steps.\n\nOn either side of the scene, large buildings line the street, indicating a densely populated area. The architecture varies, with the building directly behind the construction site featuring a stone facade and what seems to be a walled-up window or an architectural embellishment.\n\nSidewalks on both sides of the street are bordered with young trees, suggesting attempts to integrate greenery into the urban environment. The street itself appears partially blocked to accommodate the construction work, likely causing some disruption to normal traffic and pedestrian flow in this area.\n\nOverall, the scene depicts a typical urban construction site with workers and machinery engaged in road repair or utility work, surrounded by the architectural and natural elements of the city environment.","title":"The active 76th Street neighborhood association has brought a new mall and many plantings to the area of Broadway and 76th to 77th streets.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553886","551951","544812","553378","546243","553394","557479","546252","553382","550274","557742","551966","549913","554313","546266","547693"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["construction","excavation","work","site","street","worker","loader","truck","vehicle","embellishment"]}
