{"path":"543685.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene of children playing in a shallow, rocky creek surrounded by lush greenery. In the foreground, a young boy with blond hair, wearing a gray shirt and striped shorts, is focused on washing or examining something in his hands. Moving into the mid-ground, three other children are engaged in similar activities in the water. They seem to be either searching for something in the creek or playing with the water and rocks; one of them is intently bending over toward the water. The background features a dense array of green, leafy trees that provide a vibrant contrast to the sunlit sparkle of the water. The overall atmosphere of the image is one of youthful curiosity and natural, rustic exploration.","title":"The Denver P.T.A. sponsored a week-long workshop to introduce school children to the natural environment.
