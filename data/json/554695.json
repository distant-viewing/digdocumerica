{"path":"554695.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a sweeping landscape view from an elevated vantage point, overlooking a dense forest and a mist-covered lake area. The foreground features a lush canopy of trees in shades of green and earthy brown, typical of a forested terrain. Among these trees, a lookout tower stands prominently, constructed with a solid, dark frame and positioned on the left side of the image. This tower, possibly used for forest surveillance or as a scenic viewing spot, adds a unique focal point to the natural scene.\n\nBeyond the immediate forest, the landscape opens into a breath-taking vista of a lake system interspersed with numerous islands. The water bodies are partially obscured by a thick layer of mist or low-lying clouds, lending an ethereal quality to the scene. This interplay of mist with the water surface creates a sense of depth and vastness.\n\nThe background stretches into distant hills and faint outlines of further forested areas, all under a hazy sky that suggests either early morning or late afternoon light. The panorama is expansive, offering a view that encompasses various natural elementsâ€”forest, water, mist, and distant terrain, harmoniously coexisting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its rich textures and layers ranging from the immediate dense forestry to the expansive watery and misty horizon, provides a serene and majestic view of the natural world. The picture is framed to capture both the grandeur and intricate details of this landscape, showcasing the beauty of untamed nature and the quiet solitude it offers.","title":"Fire tower on bald mountain near Fourth Lake, most of the towers are no longer used because fire patrols are made by plane to save on manpower, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550579","556926","554647","552141","545001","554526","556906","556930","554754","553594","555698","554616","550541","554652","550629","556931"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mist","forest","forested","tower","surveillance","watery","panorama","encompass","bodie","viewing"]}
