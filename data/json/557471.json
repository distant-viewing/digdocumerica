{"path":"557471.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts an expansive highway scene capturing multiple lanes of traffic. The highway runs horizontally across the image and is sectioned into two separate carriageways, each supporting travel in opposite directions. Each carriageway has multiple lanes, visibly demarcated by white lines, with a wide grassy median separating the two directions of travel.\n\nThe traffic is moderate, with various vehicles captured in motion. Visible vehicles include several cars and trucks, each showing motion blur which suggests moderate speeds. Notably, there's a large semi-trailer truck in one lane, and several smaller cars in others, including a distinctive yellow van. The direction of the vehicles indicates that this highway facilitates high-speed, long-distance travel, typical of intercity or interstate routes.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is predominantly flat and appears semi-arid, with sparse vegetation and a broad, open sky that occupies the upper third of the image. The sky is overcast, contributing to a somber tone and flat lighting, which casts soft shadows on the highway. In the distance, beyond the highway, the terrain remains flat with hints of residential or industrial development very faintly visible on the horizon.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a typical highway scene set in a expansive landscape, emphasizing the scale and capacity of roadway infrastructure designed for heavy and fast-moving traffic. The image's perspective, likely taken from an overpass, offers a comprehensive view of both the robustness of human-made structures and the vast, natural landscape around it.","title":"Photograph of an interstate highway passing through camp pendleton marine base","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["547294","555437","546612","547780","549902","549890","547569","546686","552719","556785","547811","542764","548391","546713","547785","553124"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","lane","direction","travel","traffic","speed","median","truck","vehicle","demarcate"]}
