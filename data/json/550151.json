{"path":"550151.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene in a residential area bustling with everyday activities. In the foreground, a large dog, possibly a black and tan coonhound, is standing in a puddle beside a white vintage car, possibly from the 1960s or 1970s, as indicated by its classic design and tail-fins.\n\nThe street appears to be in a suburban setting, lined with traditional two-story houses featuring front porches and neat front yards. The houses mostly have similar architectural elements, suggesting they might be from a similar construction period, possibly mid-20th century.\n\nTo the right, a garbage truck is parked by the curb, with two workers busily engaged in collecting trash bins and waste, fitting a typical trash collection day scene. Behind them, the beds of trees and well-kept sidewalks extend into the distance, giving a calm, orderly feel to the neighborhood.\n\nThe road itself shows signs of neglect or wear with puddles, perhaps indicating recent rain, and debris scattering, including a few random old tires lying in the water, adding a grittier, neglected aspect to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photo depicts a snapshot of suburban life, combining elements of daily routine with those that suggest a need for maintenance or attention in the community.","title":"Sanitation department at work on East 124th and Beulah streets.
