{"path":"557228.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"The image shows a dense traffic jam on a highway under bright sunlight. Multiple lanes are filled bumper-to-bumper with vehicles primarily composed of cars and trucks. The vehicles range in style typical of late 20th-century American automotive designâ€”boxy and large, featuring sedans, station wagons, and several big trucks. The highway curves slightly to the right in the distance, hinting at a winding route. The road is flanked by green grass visible on the sides, and another parallel road can be seen looping over or under the jammed one in the background.\n\nDue to the sunlight and shadows cast by the vehicles, the image has a harsh contrast, amplifying the metallic sheen of the cars and highlighting their colors primarily in shades of black, white, and metallic. The cars and trucks are static, indicating heavy traffic without any visible movement, contributing to a sense of congestion and stillness. This suggests the photograph might capture a moment of peak traffic hours or an event leading to unusual congestion.","title":"Evening rush hour traffic on Parkway East at Pittsburgh Pennsylvania","placename":"Pittsburgh (Pa.)","location":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","nn1":["557229","545884","553727","548084","553726","549903","553018","543891","556727","553725","546711","542684","546734","546370","555437","550089"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["bumper","congestion","traffic","truck","highway","jam","car","vehicle","loop","amplify"]}
