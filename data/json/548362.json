{"path":"548362.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor industrial scene, likely a landfill or large-scale waste management operation. The view is an aerial or high angle shot, highlighting an expansive area with a curved, spiral road or track pattern on the ground, evident from the circular tire marks.\n\nThe terrain is textured and appears muddy or clay-like, predominantly in earthy tones. There is a large area in the center right of the image filled with scattered, shiny objects, which look like metallic or glass waste due to their reflective qualitiesâ€”creating a patchy white appearance against the darker soil.\n\nTwo large yellow construction vehicles, possibly bulldozers or dump trucks, are present near this central pile of waste, seemingly engaged in moving or managing the debris. Behind the operation, tracks and trails within the terrain suggest frequent vehicle movement.\n\nThis scene captures the scale and ongoing activity typical of waste management operations, emphasizing environmental management or the disposal processes in an industrial or commercial context.","title":"Solid waste covers land at Fresh Kills on Staten Island.
