{"path":"553158.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor scene at an urban public space, likely a square or park. It features a group of people engaging in various activities, centered around a large, multi-tiered stone structure that seems to be the main seating area.\n\nOn the uppermost level of the structure, three people are seen sitting elevated from the rest. Their relaxed postures and the presence of steps suggest this is a popular spot for sitting and perhaps observing the surroundings or enjoying the sun.\n\nThe main level below is bustling with a mix of people. There is a diverse group, mostly men, sitting closely together â€“ some are talking, one man is reading a newspaper, and several are just observing or soaking up the environment. They wear mostly formal or semi-formal attire, which includes suits, ties, and hats, indicative of a time when such attire was common in public spaces.\n\nThe front part of the stone structure has a few individuals sitting with their legs crossed, appearing engaged in casual conversation or simply enjoying a break. Their attention seems directed towards each other or off to the side, suggesting social interactions.\n\nThe background shows people scattered across steps and other stone structures, some engaging with each other, while others are alone, all immersed in various casual activities like sitting or talking. Trees and foliage are visible, adding a touch of nature and tranquility to the urban setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on everyday social interaction and relaxation in a public space, offers a snapshot of urban life, community dynamics, and a serene atmosphere amidst a bustling city. The attire and behaviors suggest the photo might be from several decades earlier, capturing a moment that reflects the social and cultural norms of the time.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: noon crowd enjoys the sun the flagpole steps","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553319","550751","551823","553159","551646","551829","551798","550076","551800","550302","551801","550074","551852","557258","551815","553183"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["sit","talk","stone","step","people","attire","space","level","soak","behavior"]}
