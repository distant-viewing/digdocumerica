{"path":"543233.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a moment of a group of people walking along a narrow, dirt hiking trail surrounded by lush vegetation under a clear blue sky. Toward the foreground, a young boy in a yellow sweatshirt and green pants joyfully is seen moving forward, slightly outpacing the group. Behind him, the focus falls on a group of adults and one other child.\n\nA woman to the left of the frame appears joyful as she looks up, possibly at the scenery, with a bright smile on her face. She has long, dark hair and wears a patterned shirt with a red vest. Next to her is an older man dressed in a tan cardigan over a shirt, staring straight ahead with a composed expression.\n\nBeside him, another casually dressed man in a hat looks slightly upwards to his side, appearing pensive or interested in something out of frame. A young girl with her hair tied back shields her eyes, gazing upward toward the sun or the canopy.\n\nOn the right side, partially out of shot, are more people whose presence adds to the communal feel of the outing but whose details are less discernible. The background is rich with various types of trees and shrubs, suggesting a relatively wild or natural locale. The sunny weather casts vivid natural lighting that enhances the vibrant colors of the setting and the clothing of the group. The overall mood is cheerful and leisurely, emphasizing a shared enjoyment of nature.","title":"Sierra Club nature hike","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554662","544739","543234","553357","543455","554672","551764","545512","552407","554663","553364","557985","551736","557005","554506","554705"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["group","stare","sweatshirt","tan","cardigan","shield","hair","locale","hiking","vest"]}
