{"path":"543610.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, wintry landscape dominated by snow-covered conifer trees. The composition is vertically framed, showcasing layers of forests under a soft dusky or twilight ambiance. In the foreground, dense clusters of dark evergreens are heavy with snow, slightly shrouded by mist or falling snow, creating a moody, atmospheric effect. The middle ground features slightly taller trees, standing more solitary or in small clusters on a gentle slope, also blanketed in snow. The background integrates similar trees that appear slightly lighter due to the distance or the atmospheric effects of the weather. The scene is quiet, cold, and tranquil, epitomizing a typical snowy forest scene in a mountainous or hilly region. The overall tone is somewhat somber, with a strong sense of natural beauty and calmness typical of wintry forest landscapes.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["557608","544918","557613","555110","557597","542849","555119","553574","557019","543755","557020","545297","553579","555123","544901","543406"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["snow","solitary","evergreens","dusky","cluster","snowy","wintry","effect","forest","integrate"]}
