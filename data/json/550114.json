{"path":"550114.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a sunny day on a street with a series of traditional wooden storefronts. The main part of the scene is a sidewalk view featuring a man walking towards the camera. He is dressed in a casual, warm-weather outfit: a white T-shirt and dark pants. He carries a relaxed yet confident demeanor, wearing glasses and with his hands loosely in his pockets.\n\nThe architecture along the street is characterized by white wooden siding, with multiple hanging signs advertising various businesses. Notable among them are \"Ralph and Dorothy's Café,\" \"McCam's Beauty Salon,\" and \"Earl Wartel Company.\" The inclusion of businesses such as a café, a beauty salon, and what appears to be a dress and suit company suggests that this is a commercial area catering to daily needs and services.\n\nThe signs contribute an old-fashioned charm to the scene, suggesting a small-town atmosphere. Above the man’s head, an American flag hangs, partially unfurled, adding an additional layer of Americana to the setting. The street is well-maintained, with clear, unperturbed sidewalks and vibrant sunlight casting shadows of the signs and architectural details onto the wooden surfaces.\n\nOverall, this photograph creates an evocative image of mid-20th-century small town America, focusing on everyday life, commerce, and community.","title":"Attractive storefronts and signs give new life to decaying business section of suburban Rocky River.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550130","550107","547310","550110","551106","546428","557805","558118","545333","550106","542900","550115","552526","557655","552602","545327"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["sidewalk","business","street","town","café","sign","inclusion","need","pocket","storefront"]}
