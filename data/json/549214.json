{"path":"549214.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural, pastoral scene with several prominent elements. In the foreground, a group of cattle, variously posed as either standing or lying down, dominates a grassy field. The cows are scattered across the scene, each at a different depth in the composition, adding a sense of scale and space. The field appears lush and dense, indicative perhaps of a wet, temperate climate.\n\nIn the middle and background of the image, the landscape gradually elevates into a rolling hill. Atop this hill, a significant distance from the cattle, there is a large industrial structure emitting a plume of dark smoke into the sky. This smoke trails off towards the right side of the image, suggesting the direction of the wind and adding a dynamic element to the otherwise serene landscape.\n\nThe horizon is expansive and marked by a clear skyline that contrasts sharply with the darker tones of the foreground and the smoke. The lighting in the photograph suggests either early morning or late evening, casting a soft ambient light that accents the natural undulation of the landscape and the industrial activity at a distance. The contrast between the pastoral foreground and the industrial background creates a visual and thematic juxtaposition, possibly alluding to themes of nature versus human activity or environmental impact.","title":"Cattle graze on ranch lands near the dave johnston power plant","placename":"Wyoming","location":"Wyoming","nn1":["543010","543012","555645","545153","542626","546102","548984","549191","550833","554560","542960","543668","542627","557439","557022","552465"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["cattle","smoke","perhaps","ambient","undulation","cow","trails","field","accent","emitte"]}
