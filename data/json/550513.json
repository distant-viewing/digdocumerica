{"path":"550513.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a landscape that appears to be a vast, serene wilderness. The image is a panoramic view of a mountainous region with a dramatic range of sharply rising peaks in the background, their tops appearing rugged and partially snow-capped. These mountains dominate the skyline, hinting at a remote purity.\n\nThe mid-ground consists of large, undulating hills lush with green foliage that shows variation in color shades, possibly due to different types of vegetation or the interplay of light and shadow. These large hills cradle a meandering river in the valley below, its silvery waters snaking through the landscape and catching glints of light.\n\nThe foreground is rich in similar greenery but also shows more detailed contours of the land, emphasizing the rugged terrain formed by erosion and geological shifts. The river, likely originating from higher elevations, has carved out a distinct path through the valley, contributing to the formation of various smaller streams that feed into it.\n\nThe natural scenery is pristine and untouched, without any visible signs of human activity or habitation, offering a pure view into a natural ecosystem. Overall, the photograph conveys a sense of peace and untouched wilderness, typical of remote mountainous terrains, possibly useful for contexts discussing geography, natural history, or environmental conservation.","title":"The Chandalar Shelf uplift as seen from the headwaters of the Dietrich River. This view looks northeast up the shelf. Pipeline and road will ascend the Bluff to reach the shelf proper, then proceed straight across the northwestern tributary of the north fork of the Chandalar River seen in the middle distance.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550441","550629","550512","550511","550510","550401","555690","550523","550497","550529","550609","555660","550500","550596","550509","550518"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["valley","wilderness","glint","geography","shift","peace","hill","conservation","history","river"]}
