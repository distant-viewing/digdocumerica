{"path":"547768.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This is a photograph of a historical marker, specifically a Texas Historical Survey Committee sign. The sign is titled \"WORLD'S RICHEST ACRE\" and describes a notable historic site related to oil production in East Texas.\n\nThe sign itself is rectangular, mounted upright on a sturdy grey post and set against a rural or suburban environment. The upper part of the sign features the state emblem of Texas, with a prominent star and the word \"TEXAS\" placed at the very top. \n\nThe text on the placard gives historical information about an exceptionally productive oil field discovered in 1930, particularly emphasizing its status as \"the most densely drilled tract in the world.\" It mentions that the area once had over 1,200 oil wells and has produced over two and a half million barrels of crude oil, thereby generating considerable wealth.\n\nIn the background, we can slightly see a landscape that includes grass and trees, suggestive of a relatively open space. Other than the text and the emblem, there are no significant design elements on the sign, emphasizing its informative and educational purpose.","title":"Marker on i-20 near Longview commemorates the discovery in 1930 of the east Texas oilfield, the \"world's richest acre\".
