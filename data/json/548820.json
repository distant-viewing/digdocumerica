{"path":"548820.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a large farming area. The major visual feature of the image is a stark contrast between two large fields: one on the left being a rich green color, suggesting a densely planted crop, and one on the right displaying soil and crop rows, indicating it is either recently harvested or being prepared for sowing.\n\nCentral in the image, there's a farming vehicle, possibly a tractor, with attached machinery, actively working the field. This vehicle is creating noticeable lines in the soil, likely part of the plowing or planting process. The vehicle is moving from the bottom to the top of the frame, as suggested by the direction of the cultivated lines in the field.\n\nThe landscape is flat and expansive, emphasizing the broad scale of agriculture in this area. There are no visible buildings, trees, or other landmarks, giving an impression of a rural and agricultural-dominated region. The colors are vibrant, with the green crop providing a fresh and lively look, contrasting with the earthy tones of the tilled field. This setup efficiently encapsulates a typical large-scale farming operation, highlighting the machinery and method used in modern agriculture.","title":"Irrigated field of the Imperial Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548902","548898","548907","554202","548991","544548","544552","548950","547297","548903","549104","558414","552858","554029","554056","542708"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["farming","crop","field","agriculture","soil","vehicle","planting","machinery","method","scale"]}
