{"path":"555466.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures an individual engaged in the act of locking or unlocking a vehicle's gas cap. The person, whose face is not entirely visible, appears to be a man from the glimpse of his side profile. He is dressed in a dark coat and a scarf, indicating it might be cold weather. Behind him is a large, brightly colored yellow sign on a vehicle that prominently states \"WE HAVE LOCKING GAS CAPS\". The text on the sign is styled in capital letters, black outlined with white filling, enhancing visibility and readability.\n\nThe focus of the image is on the man and his interaction with the car's fuel tank area. He is using a key on the gas cap, suggesting a narrative about security or prevention against gas theft, a problem that may have been particularly pressing when the photo was taken.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, with indistinct architectural structures and a clear sky, indicating the setting might be an outdoor parking area or near a roadside. The emphasis on the sign suggests that this might be a gas station or a related service area which deals in automotive accessories or safety products.","title":"Sales of gasoline tank locks increased dramatically during the fuel crisis in the Pacific Northwest, and their prices doubled.
