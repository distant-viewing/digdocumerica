{"path":"554185.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features a cluster of colorful and bold signs advertising various products and services, likely in front of a roadside store. The signs are densely packed and layered, each sign displaying a different advertisement. The signs are mounted on poles, stacked above and beside each other creating a visually crowded space. \n\nAt the top of the assembly, there is a neon-light sign shaped like an arrow, partially lit, with the word \"FILM\" followed by \"Gifts Moccasins.\" Below that, there are several signs in different shapes and sizes displaying texts such as \"GIFTS,\" \"Moccasins,\" \"CHENILLE RUGS ROBES,\" and \"BEDSPREADS\" in bold, capital letters. Additionally, there's a sign advertising \"Pepsi\" alongside other small signs indicating that they accept credit cards (Master Charge and BankAmericard).\n\nThe signs are predominantly red, black, and yellow, contributing to their attention-grabbing appearance. In the background, there is a plain, single-story building which appears quite simple compared to the bold signs in the foreground. The sky is overcast, and the lighting suggests it might be an overcast day.\n\nOverall, the composition draws the viewer's attention to the variety of items for sale, reflecting a typical roadside commercial setup intended to attract travelers or local customers.","title":"Near the town of Wisconsin Dells the Wisconsin River channels through deep, soft sandstone cliffs, cutting the rock into fantastic shapes. These natural splendors have given rise to a booming tourist industry. People come in droves, often in campers and trailers. Boat trips, shops, bars, and diversions of every kind vie for patronage in an amusement complex extending 2 or 3 miles beyond the town.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547021","551323","549008","553017","549113","549017","554184","551495","555439","545618","549871","545154","549224","554550","555438","543814"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["sign","roadside","card","robe","capital","arrow","traveler","neon","assembly","customer"]}
