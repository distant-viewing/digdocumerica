{"path":"553405.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph captures three young men on a wooden platform beside a body of water, likely a river or lake, with lush greenery and trees in the background, bathed in sunlight. The scene suggests a warm, sunny day, perfect for outdoor activities.\n\nThe three men are engaged in what appears to be the setup or initial stages of a rowing activity. Two of the men are standing each at one end of a long, narrow boat, holding it steady. The man on the right is wearing a white T-shirt with a logo and khaki shorts, while the man on the left wears a gray tank top and darker shorts. Both wear white socks almost up to their knees, and their expressions are focused.\n\nThe third man is in between them, on his knees on the platform, also wearing similar clothingâ€”a white sleeveless top and slightly lighter shorts. He is actively involved in adjusting or holding a pole vertically, which seems to be part of a mechanism perhaps related to the launching or stabilization of the boat.\n\nThe overall mood is casual and focused, highlighting a moment of teamwork and preparation among friends engaged in a rowing sport in a serene, natural setting. The composition of the image, combined with the placement of the individuals and the surrounding nature, conveys a sense of peacefulness and camaraderie.","title":"Visiting crew at Groton School on the Nashua River.
