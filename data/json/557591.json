{"path":"557591.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and moody nature scene during a sunset or sunrise. The central focus is a large, dark silhouette of a cliff or rocky outcrop, which juts into the frame from the right. Atop and along the edges of this cliff, precarious-looking trees and exposed roots are visible, suggesting that the soil is eroding or that the cliff is steep. These trees are dark against the sky, outlined by the light, and contribute to a feeling of rugged wilderness.\n\nIn the background, the sky is filled with heavy and ominous clouds predominantly in dark blues and blacks, which suggest an impending storm or the ending of one. Toward the bottom left corner of the image, the sun appears as a bright, golden spot, partially obscured by the clouds, casting a warm light that contrasts with the overall dark tones of the scene.\n\nThis light diffuses subtly through the clouds, illuminating them from behind and creating a dramatic interplay of light and shadow. The composition utilizes strong contrasts and the interplay between light and dark to convey a sense of isolation and the raw power of nature.","title":"An example of soil lost by erosion on a steep slope that was clear-cut in the olympic national timberland, Washington.
