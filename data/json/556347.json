{"path":"556347.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts four miners taking a break and sitting on a yellow industrial vehicle, possibly a rail cart, inside a mining environment. They are all wearing traditional mining gear: hard hats with lamps attached, and coveralls that appear to be soiled from work. Each miner displays a unique posture and expression, contributing to the candid and relaxed atmosphere of the scene.\n\nFrom left to right: the first miner is sitting with one arm resting on the cart, looking slightly away from the camera with a serious expression. The second miner sits more casually, crossing one leg over the other and with a slight smile, engaging in conversation with his companion. The third miner sits upright attentively, also looking towards his companion. The fourth miner, seated on the far right, is bringing a cigarette to his mouth, eyes averted from the camera.\n\nIn front of them, on the ground, are their lunch boxes and personal items, possibly including tools and safety gear -- characteristic canvas bags, a metal lunch box, and a plastic water cooler. These personal effects suggest they might be either preparing for a meal break or just resuming work after one.\n\nThe background is simple and utilitarian, typical of a mining site, featuring rocky and barren terrain which provides a stark contrast to the miners' vibrant yellow cart. This landscape reinforces the industrial and rugged nature of their work environment. The lighting and composition further focus the viewerâ€™s attention on the workers and their immediate surroundings, highlighting their expressions and the casual interaction among them.","title":"Group of miners waiting to go to work on the 4 p.m. to midnight shift at the Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia.
