{"path":"552297.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph portrays a serene lakeside scene featuring four sailboats anchored in calm waters. In the foreground, three sailboats are moored closely together at a wooden dock, their sails neatly furled. The boats have distinctive cabins and masts, and their reflections are subtly mirrored in the smooth water surface. Among these, one is named \"Major Goose\" and another is identified with the label \"Ramblin'\". An additional sailboat can be seen in the background, sailing away from the dock area, its white sail contrasted against the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe background consists of a densely wooded hillside, providing a lush green backdrop to the scene. Below this forested area, the shore is visible with a trace of a beach. The light, either from late afternoon or early morning, casts gentle hues over the scene, contributing to the tranquil atmosphere. This setting suggests a secluded or perhaps private docking area, nestled in a natural environment that evokes a sense of peace and relaxation.","title":"Sailboats at gig harbor in southern puget sound","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["547757","547754","544669","543545","548555","542903","548247","552296","549411","543936","557562","552355","546856","547781","548118","554610"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","sail","dock","docking","trace","peace","mast","anchor","identify","cabin"]}
