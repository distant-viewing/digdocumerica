{"path":"545277.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene from a coastal viewpoint. The composition is layered, with the foreground featuring rugged, rocky terrain covered with dry grass, indicative of a coastal bluff. This portion of the landscape is inhabited by dark green coniferous trees, which frame the image and add depth by partially veiling the scenery beyond.\n\nIn the middle ground lies the calm blue sea, stretching out to the horizon. A large cargo ship is the focal point in this middle area, stationed in the water. The ship, painted in light hues and equipped with multiple visible cranes and masts, contrasts starkly against the distant backdrop, suggesting it might be involved in transport or logistic operations.\n\nThe distant background reveals a hazy outline of mountains, probably a far shore or island, under a light blue sky. The overall lighting suggests it's either early morning or late evening, given the softness of the light and the shadows cast over the landscape. \n\nThis tranquil scene conveys a sense of quiet isolation, possibly a location often frequented by those seeking a moment of solitude or a picturesque view of the natural coastal beauty mixed with human maritime activity.","title":"Ship passes San Juan Island","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544713","542870","552000","544976","555706","555694","556924","557818","554004","557510","543329","544655","542907","543068","543402","544383"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ship","inhabit","seek","veil","frequent","softness","mast","island","cargo","viewpoint"]}
