{"path":"547603.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach setting. In the foreground, there are lush bushes with vibrant purple flowers, possibly beach heather, partially covering the sandy ground. These plants add rich colors and depth to the scene, appearing slightly blurred which suggests they are closer to the camera lens.\n\nThe middle ground features a sandy beach where a group of people are present, engaging in casual beach activities. Two adults and two children can be seen; the adults are closer to the camera. One adult is holding the hand of a child, while the other walks slightly ahead. Another child is further back towards the water's edge.\n\nThe background consists of a calm sea that meets a clear sky on the horizon, emphasizing the peacefulness and vastness of the ocean view. The overall lighting is bright, indicative of a sunny day, which casts gentle shadows on the beach and highlights the textures of the sand and plants.","title":"Wild roses and beach grass on the dune","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["547599","547592","547596","547612","543193","554159","543303","543493","557507","545280","555402","547009","546982","543254","543089","543072"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","adult","child","lens","peacefulness","camera","plant","meet","vastness","sand"]}
