{"path":"545904.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a body of water with distinct sediment or pollutant patterns. The water ranges in color from dark blue to lighter shades, indicative of varying depths or the presence of materials suspended in the water. A prominent feature is a large, irregular-shaped deposit of sediment or sand, colored in light grey and beige, that forms several broad, rounded bands within the water. These extend from a point near the shoreline and appear to disperse progressively into the water body.\n\nThe shoreline is bordered by a dense strip of vegetation, perhaps small bushes or trees, which is interspersed with clearer areas showing bare soil or sand. This vegetative barrier appears to follow the contour of the shoreline, and its presence suggests a boundary that might serve ecological functions like erosion control or habitat.\n\nAt the bottom of the frame, a constructed area includes a path or road running parallel to the shore, indicating human activity or access. The terrain around the road is lighter colored, possibly sandy or composed of light soil, which contrasts with the darker vegetation and the water.\n\nOverall, the composition presents a serene, natural setting while subtly indicating human presence and potential environmental interactions such as sediment runoff or waterway management practices.","title":"Effluent flowing into Houston Ship Channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["552922","549538","548001","551176","550638","547098","555705","545014","547053","546109","543697","543652","551608","549504","544042","555860"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["sediment","shoreline","sand","water","runoff","soil","presence","pollutant","disperse","deposit"]}
