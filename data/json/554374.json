{"path":"554374.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"In the photograph, a woman stands next to a car at what appears to be an auto show. She is wearing a long, flowing, teal dress with a deep V-neck and a large belt around the waist. Her hair is styled straight and she wears matching teal makeup. She has on open-toed sandals. The car is a dark sedan with the front door open, showcasing its interior. Behind the woman and the car, there is a red background with \"MANTA LUXUS\" in white capitalized letters. The overall setting seems to be a promotional event for the car, and the woman likely serves as a model to attract attention to the vehicle. The carpet underfoot is beige, and there appears to be an electrical cable curling on the floor near the womanâ€™s feet.","title":"AutoMobile show at the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554371","554381","557918","554385","554378","552790","554383","552783","554387","554372","554375","554388","552782","551927","552788","554376"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["teal","woman","car","v","auto","sandal","carpet","waist","show","foot"]}
