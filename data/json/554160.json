{"path":"554160.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a sunny beach scene populated with beach-goers and their beach gear. The image shows a sandy beach area dotted with multiple colorful beach umbrellas, predominantly in shades of red and blue, providing shade to various beach chairs beneath them. These chairs are mostly arranged in pairs, and many of them seem to have a low table placed in between them. A few individuals can be seen seated on these chairs, either relaxing or conversing casually.\n\nThe sand has a light color and the beach appears to be expansive, extending along the visible area of the photo. There are some sandy pathways leading towards the water, where small waves can be seen. This suggests the proximity of a calm sea. The atmosphere of the beach looks tranquil and leisurely, with visitors spaced comfortably apart.\n\nThe picture is taken from a high viewpoint looking down on the beach, which provides a comprehensive view of the layout and activity without focusing intimately on any details or individuals. The edges of the image show vague hints of foliage, suggesting that the beach may be bordered by some vegetation, providing a natural frame to the scene. The lighting and shadow suggest midday sun, highlighting the brightness and vibrancy of the beach setting.","title":"Maunce kea beach hotel, near Kamuela, is located on one of the few sandy beaches in all of Hawaii.
