{"path":"546223.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph features a woman sitting on large metal pipes that are partially submerged in water. She dips her bare feet into the flowing water as she looks off to the side, giving the scene a contemplative mood. She is dressed in a casual, stylish manner with a navy blue short-sleeve shirt that is slightly unbuttoned at the top and tucked into light-colored capri pants. Her accessories include large, round sunglasses that add to her chic appearance.\n\nThe setting appears to be outdoors, possibly near a rural road, given the visible dirt and vegetation in the background which includes green bushes and scattered plants. The sunlight is bright, highlighting her figure against the shadows cast by the curved pipes, which have a metallic sheen and show some signs of wear and rust.\n\nThe composition of the image with the woman centered among the curving lines of the pipes creates a visually striking contrast between nature, industrial elements, and human presence. This setting might suggest a theme of relaxation and escape in an unusual environment.","title":"Leakey resident cooling her feet in the Rio Frio","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["548291","554553","550940","549322","553156","544339","550242","552700","551249","551448","543835","550748","551468","549998","555395","547121"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["pipe","navy","accessory","sheen","foot","manner","woman","relaxation","rust","sunglass"]}
