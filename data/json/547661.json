{"path":"547661.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image depicts a barren landscape marked by environmental devastation or clearance. The foreground features muddy terrain interspersed with water-filled patches and scattered debris, primarily consisting of twigs, branches, and small pieces of wood, contributing to an overall sense of destruction or neglect.\n\nA notable aspect is the central elongated pool of water reflecting a clear blue sky. Litter and organic debris are visible within this water, along with some grassy plants around the edges, suggesting a vague presence of life in this otherwise desolate landscape.\n\nThe middle and background show mounded piles of similar debris and dead tree stumps, emphasizing the widespread clearance. There are a few sparse, leafless trees and shrubs standing in isolation, appearing lifeless against the largely flat horizon. The environment is bathed in bright sunlight, casting shadows that enhance the rough textures of the ground and wooden remains.\n\nOverall, the composition and the content of the photograph highlight significant ecological disruption, possibly from logging, natural disaster, or landscaping, creating a powerful visual narrative of environmental impact.","title":"Land advertised for sale by developer at Point Judith","placename":"Block Island Sound (R.I.)","location":"Block Island Sound, Rhode Island","nn1":["547527","546060","545264","542863","545138","542865","555148","555136","555150","547665","555092","545254","542819","542850","555384","545289"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["clearance","debris","remain","devastation","twig","disruption","disaster","stump","landscaping","destruction"]}
