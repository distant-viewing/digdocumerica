{"path":"549560.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic viewpoint at a large waterfall, most likely Niagara Falls, given its distinctive flowing curve and the considerable volume of water cascading down. In the foreground, a multitude of tourists are gathered along a viewing platform, closely observing the waterfall and taking in the view. The platform appears to be secured with railings, ensuring the safety of the visitors.\n\nMost of the individuals on the platform are dressed in fashion typical of the 1970s, suggesting the era in which the photo was taken. Some are wearing bright-colored trousers, jackets, and patterned shirts. There is a mix of ages among the spectators, from children to adults.\n\nThe falls themselves are a powerful presence in the image, with white, rushing water plunging down in a wide curve. The mist from the waterfall can be seen rising above where the water hits below, possibly contributing to a light spray felt by those on the viewing platform. The rushing water and its constant motion contrast with the static and attentive crowd of tourists, creating a dynamic interplay between natureâ€™s raw power and human curiosity and enjoyment.","title":"Tourists on Goat Island at the brink of the cataract enjoy a spectacular view of the American Falls. The Niagara River swirls around the island, falling in two parts, one on the American and the other on the Canadian side of the escarpment.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549546","549467","549536","549534","552397","549466","549535","549537","549562","549563","549530","549557","549545","549544","549549","549558"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["platform","waterfall","tourist","curve","multitude","volume","spray","spectator","curiosity","water"]}
