{"path":"545525.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and introspective moment on what appears to be the porch of an old, weathered house. A person is seated on a wooden chair, deeply engrossed in reading a book. They are dressed in a casual, sleeveless, knee-length dress or housecoat that has a geometric pattern. Their posture is bent forward toward the book, indicating concentration or deep interest. The individual wears simple dark shoes. Next to the chair, a brown dog with a smooth coat is standing, part of its body obscured by the chair, seemingly in a calm state, possibly looking away from the camera or at something in the distance.\n\nThe setting includes a series of slim, vertical wooden columns supporting the porch roof, which also features a degraded, slightly sagging awning or overhead wooden structure with peeling paint, hinting at the age and neglected maintainance of the building. This porch overlooks a street where older model cars are parked, suggesting this photo may have been taken several decades ago. In the background, distant power lines and lush green vegetation are visible, which might indicate a suburban or rural community setting.\n\nOverall, the setting evokes a sense of quiet daily life and casual home front activity, possibly during a warm day given the attire and open outdoor setting. This picture gives a glimpse into a peaceful moment, contrasting with the aged and somewhat dilapidated environment.","title":"Resident of \"little korea\", a low income area in south Birmingham","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545510","546990","555580","548609","557761","557676","556489","553483","553535","548613","546478","553485","553222","554193","555581","546474"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["porch","chair","book","peeling","awning","engross","dilapidate","overlook","dog","knee"]}
