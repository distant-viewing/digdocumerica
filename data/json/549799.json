{"path":"549799.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene focused on waste management and transportation. A large barge, painted red with a cabin at its end, is moving along a water channel filled with trash and debris. The barge is enclosed by walls that contain the floating rubbish, preventing it from dispersing into the broader waterway.\n\nThe trash on the barge and piled along the sides of the channel consists largely of broken boxes, discarded packaging, and other refuse, indicating a massive scale of waste. In the background, industrial structures, including tall towers and buildings, are visible, suggesting that this scene is set in an urban area with significant industrial activity. A bridge is faintly visible in the distance, further establishing this as an urban setting.\n\nThe sky is clear, and the lighting indicates it is either midday or early afternoon, providing bright illumination and deep shadows that accentuate the vivid red color of the barge against the muted colors of the trash and industrial backdrop. The composition of the photograph leads the viewerâ€™s eye from the foreground with the barge and trash directly towards the industrial background, emphasizing the environmental impact of human activities in urban settings.","title":"Tugboat herds two laden garbage scows down the East River from transfer point at 91st Street.
