{"path":"546769.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial landscape featuring a prominent steelworks facility. The setting includes multiple tall chimneys that emit smoke, suggesting heavy industrial activity. The scene is divided by a body of water that reflects some of the structures and smoke, enhancing the industrial atmosphere of the image.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several large cargo cranes painted in red, stationed at a dock where cargo ships are moored. These cranes are presumably used for loading and unloading goods, indicative of a bustling port area. The waterway appears to be a busy channel, aiding in the transport of materials essential for the adjacent factories.\n\nThe heavy smog and overcast skies contribute to a somber mood, highlighting environmental impacts commonly associated with such industrial zones. The overall color tone is washed out, with grays and muted blues dominating, possibly due to the time period or the atmospheric conditions when the photograph was taken.\n\nTowards the background, the industrial complex continues with numerous structures, some of which appear to be furnaces and processing plants integral to steel production. The dense layout and continuous operation of these facilities suggest a significant industrial hub, critical to economic activities in this region.\n\nNo people are visible in the scene, focusing the viewer's attention entirely on the industrial elements and the environmental setting. The composition is structured to give a broad overview, emphasizing the scale and impact of industrial activities on the landscape.","title":"Bethlehem steel plant at sparrows point, on a hazy day","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["545236","549510","547101","549508","547696","557246","557215","549511","550344","552179","557216","550868","549966","553891","546882","546862"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["cargo","crane","furnace","smog","smoke","unloading","overview","impact","facility","wash"]}
