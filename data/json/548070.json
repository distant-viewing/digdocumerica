{"path":"548070.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial landscape featuring a large factory complex located beside a body of water, possibly a river or lake. The scene is dense with industrial infrastructure: several large buildings, storage tanks, and tall chimneys, some of which are emitting smoke or steam. The distant background is dominated by forest-covered hills, partially shrouded in mist or low clouds, adding a layer of natural texture to the composition.\n\nIn the foreground, the body of water features a few small boats and a visible dock or pier structure. Across the water, a line of cars and small vehicles is parked in a neat row, visible beside the factory, suggesting a parking area for the plant's workers. The overall color palette of the image is cool, with prominent grays and blues, which might indicate overcast weather conditions during the time of the photograph. This setting underscores a contrast between the industrial activity and the natural environment surrounding it.","title":"Weyerhaeuser Company plant on the Columbia River.
