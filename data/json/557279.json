{"path":"557279.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban scene with four people walking along a paved path. In the foreground, three individuals appear to be together, walking from right to left. These include a young child and two older women, the adult woman in bright orange and the older child in a pink coat. There is also a younger woman walking in the opposite direction to the left, dressed casually in dark colors.\n\nThe background features modern city skyscrapers partially shrouded in haze, suggesting distance and perhaps pollution or morning mist. Adjacent to the path are rows of brick apartment buildings which look relatively new, with a design typical of mid-to-late 20th-century urban architecture.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of everyday urban life, probably in a residential area close to the commercial center of a city, illustrating a contrast between residential living spaces and the commercial cityscape. The image also conveys a sense of the era, likely in the late 20th century, through the style of clothing and the architectural designs.","title":"New housing has replaced the old rundown area of Northside. The low-cost dwellings are near the central business district and easily accessible to downtown by public transit or by walking. The former slum area is attracting an increasing number of people who view city life as an attractive alternative to the suburbs.","placename":"Pittsburgh (Pa.)","location":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","nn1":["557272","556199","549923","551815","549916","545415","545231","546443","549992","549907","551835","549645","551829","556226","553184","555895"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["woman","path","child","century","city","apartment","design","living","skyscraper","direction"]}
