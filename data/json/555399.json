{"path":"555399.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a vast, sandy landscape characterized by wide, ripple-like patterns on the surface, likely shaped by water or wind. A small figure can be seen in the distance, on the left side of the frame, which gives scale to the expansive terrain. The person appears to be walking towards the foreground along the beach. In the background, dramatic, steep mountains flank the scene on both sides, creating a valley-like appearance beneath a cloudy sky. This backdrop suggests the photograph may have been taken in a coastal or river valley region. The combination of the rhythmic sand patterns and the majestic mountains creates a serene and somewhat isolated atmosphere.","title":"Beach is a part of the river beds on the Columbia River never seen before and exposed more than three months because of a lack of precipitation the previous year. This scene is at Rooster Rock State Park 18 miles east of Portland.","placename":"Oregon","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545199","549037","551553","548230","547717","555400","551554","545200","543097","557459","550490","543055","545855","551232","545203","547015"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["valley","mountain","pattern","combination","wind","ripple","sand","beach","region","figure"]}
