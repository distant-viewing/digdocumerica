{"path":"542921.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an industrial logging operation located beside a body of water. The scene captures several large clusters of logs that are tightly packed and floating on the water, organized into rectangular formations. These log clusters are situated near the shoreline where the industrial facility is located.\n\nThe facility itself includes multiple buildings, including a large warehouse with silver roofs and a distinctive dark-roofed tower that resembles a traditional sawmill burner. There are also other smaller structures and vehicles, suggesting active industrial operations. The area around the buildings appears to be mostly dirt and gravel, with scattered equipment and materials.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes a mix of light and dark water, presumably due to shadows and varying water depth or sediment. The topography and the presence of a large number of logs suggest that this facility is primarily involved in the processing or transportation of logs, likely linked to forestry and lumber production. The overall composition and details of the photograph, such as the structural organization of the logs and the layout of the industrial facility, emphasize a systematic approach to timber processing.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542940","552170","542944","552140","552163","552199","542943","542941","552132","542945","552198","542942","552162","552214","552161","542946"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","facility","processing","burner","cluster","lumber","approach","operation","forestry","organization"]}
