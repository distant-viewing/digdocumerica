{"path":"546331.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil river scene where two individuals are engaged in ecological or environmental work. They appear to be conducting a form of water or biological sampling, possibly assessing aquatic life or water quality. The primary focus is on these two individuals using a large net to gather samples or study aquatic organisms. One person is partially submerged in the river, holding the net, while the other is standing near the edge providing assistance.\n\nThe setting is lush and verdant, indicating a natural, possibly secluded environment. The background is framed by large, hanging branches draped with Spanish moss, typical of wetland or riparian areas in certain regions like the Southeastern United States.\n\nIn the foreground, a motorboat labeled with an \"EPA\" (Environmental Protection Agency) insignia dominates the lower part of the frame. It's moored to the shore, suggesting that it provided transport for the scientists or researchers doing the fieldwork. The presence of the EPA logo suggests this activity is government-related, focused on environmental assessment or conservation.\n\nThe calm water and dense greenery create a peaceful yet vibrant setting, emphasizing the importance and serenity of natural environments. The composition effectively conveys a moment of scientific study and environmental management, highlighting the interaction between humans and nature in a monitoring or conservation effort.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory: personnel are seining for contaminated female shrimp.
