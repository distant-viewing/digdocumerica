{"path":"546376.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene of a rural street bustling with activity. Its composition conveys a sense of everyday rural life, possibly taken during the mid-20th century given the style of clothing and color palette.\n\nThe road runs through the center of the image, leading the viewer's eye from the foreground to the distant horizon. It is flanked by grassy areas and a few modest buildings. On the right edge of the photo, there’s a large wooden structure, possibly a storehouse or barn, with a faded sign just below its gabled roof.\n\nIn terms of human activity, the scene is lively and varied:\n1. In the forefront, a man in a light shirt and dark pants walks towards the left side of the image, carrying a white bucket in one hand.\n2. Nearby, two young children are walking down the middle of the road, also carrying buckets, possibly returning from fetching water or engaged in similar chores.\n3. A bit further back, another individual walks along the road, near the center. The person is wearing a hat, giving a rural feel to the attire.\n4. In the middle of the road, there’s a truck moving away from the viewer, filled with several people who seem to be either workers or passengers.\n\nAnimal life is also present, adding to the rustic atmosphere:\n1. A single cow ambles down the road, heading towards the children and the man with the bucket.\n2. A few scattered chickens peck at the ground near the buildings.\n\nThe environment features lush green vegetation under a somewhat cloudy sky, enhancing the feeling of a fresh, rural landscape. Power lines stretch along the road, indicating the spread of modern amenities into less urban areas.\n\nOverall, the photograph is rich with details that tell stories of rural community life, combining elements of work, daily chores, and a mix of young and older residents in a rustic setting.","title":"Mountain farm","placename":"Ponce (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543044","546380","547316","551100","555635","549257","551116","547354","555818","555609","549235","554130","543117","544406","551105","545372"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["bucket","road","walk","carry","middle","return","child","amenity","life","tell"]}
