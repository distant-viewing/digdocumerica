{"path":"544266.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and serene lakeside setting. In the foreground, a wooden structure, likely a dock or part of a pier, is prominently displayed. The weathered wood has a rugged texture with visible holes and a metal cable running alongside it. This leads the viewer's eye towards the lake.\n\nOn the water, several small boats are dotted across the frame. Each boat has one or more individuals engaged in various activities. Some appear to be preparing to row, while others are adjusting their positions or sitting relaxed. The calm water and overcast sky suggest a tranquil, slightly gloomy day, possibly in the early morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe background is a vast expanse of water that merges with the gray sky on the horizon, enhancing the sense of quietude and isolation. The scene lacks strong, vibrant colors, featuring more subdued, earthy tones that evoke a sense of timelessness and simplicity. This photograph captures a moment of everyday life by the water, highlighting interactions between the people and their environment.","title":"Crab fishermen","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["543579","544567","550324","551679","544260","544126","557562","545936","549417","554552","550674","543527","553440","546856","557563","552283"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["timelessness","hole","quietude","boat","lakeside","water","cable","pier","simplicity","position"]}
