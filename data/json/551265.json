{"path":"551265.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, rustic setting, most likely at an outdoor recreational area or a park-like environment. Its focal point is a wooden, multi-level structure, reminiscent of a large gazebo or open-air pavilion.\n\nIn the foreground, there's an overhanging roof that shelters a table, creating a cozy nook. Beneath the roof is a long wooden table accompanied by benches, suggesting this area is used for dining or gatherings. The roof, supported by thick, dark wooden beams, extends horizontally, casting shadows and creating a play of light on the surfaces below.\n\nThe midground prominently features a woman standing at an elevated part of the structure. She is leaning against a railing, surrounded by vertical wooden posts that uphold the structure's integrity and aesthetic. Her casual summer clothing, including a sleeveless top and shorts, and her relaxed posture leaning on the railing, suggest a casual, leisurely day out. She appears happy and perhaps slightly amused, contributing to the laid-back ambiance of the scene.\n\nFurther behind her, the wooden architecture continues, with more open spaces enclosed by railings, indicating multiple levels and sections of this extensive pavilion. There are visible decorations like hanging plants and lanterns, enhancing the rustic charm of the venue.\n\nThe background shows dense foliage, with leaves partially obscuring the structure but also blending harmoniously with the wooden tones. The natural greenery suggests that this pavilion is set in a wooded or park area, providing a natural retreat space for visitors.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on wooden architectural elements, the positioning of the woman, and the integration of natural surroundings, evokes a sense of tranquility and leisure, typical of a retreat in a natural park setting.","title":"Mrs.  Charles welek on ground level patio-balcony of the welek's house overlooking lake ozark.
