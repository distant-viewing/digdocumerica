{"path":"549273.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures a scene under an overpass where three individuals, possibly friends, are gathered around what appears to be an old, broken-down car. The setting is somewhat industrial, with multiple levels of concrete infrastructure visible, including bridges and roads, presumably part of a highway system.\n\nThe car in question is an older model, noticeable by its design and bodywork. It has a flat tire on the front passenger side, and the hood is propped open, indicating mechanical issues are being attended to. Next to the car, there's a spare tire lying on the ground.\n\nThe three people are engrossed in what seems like an attempt to fix the car. They are dressed casually in jackets and jeans, fitting for what could be a cooler, overcast day, as suggested by the lighting and absence of shadows in the image. Their attire and hairstyles hint that the photo could be from a past decade, possibly the 1970s or 1980s. Each person is focused on either the car or the task being performed, displaying expressions of concentration and concern.\n\nThe environment around them looks a bit worn down and neglected with weeds and grass pushing through the pavement, enhancing the sense of an impromptu car repair situation in a less maintained, urban locality. The color palette is rather muted, with greys, blues, and earth tones dominating, adding to the gritty, vintage aesthetic of the scene.","title":"Logan airport area.
