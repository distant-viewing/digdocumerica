{"path":"551193.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic, elevated view of a valley or river gorge. The setting primarily features densely forested hillsides, with the tree canopy showing variances in green hues, suggesting different types of vegetation or tree species. Directly below, parts of the landscape have been cleared, showing exposed earth and rubble, indicating recent or ongoing construction or excavation activities. \n\nOn the left side, a road winds its way through the forest, with sections of guardrails visible, curving in accordance with the terrain. At the center and towards the right side of the image, there appears to be construction related to a dam or water management facility. You can see several buildings, possibly associated with the operation of the dam, and a water body impounded behind the dam structure.\n\nIt also features several water bodies seen in the middle distance. A river or reservoir curves serpentinely through the landscape, surrounded by a lush green landscape, enhancing the scenic beauty of the place despite the interruptions of construction. There are no visible people or animals in the image, highlighting the focus on nature and infrastructure. The overall composition underscores the interaction between human activities, specifically infrastructure development, and the natural environment.","title":"Hills above the Valley Camp Coal Company in Shrewsbury show scars from past strip-mining.","placename":"Charleston (W.
