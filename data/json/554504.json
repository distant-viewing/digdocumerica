{"path":"554504.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"In this photograph, two hikers are depicted in a vast mountainous landscape. To the left, one hiker stands jubilantly, raising a walking stick above his head, while the other person, on the right, wearing a red backpack and a hat, is walking up a rock-covered trail. The terrain is rugged and partially covered with small green shrubs, indicating high altitude or a sparsely vegetated area.\n\nThe backdrop features a sweeping view of multiple mountain ranges stretching into the distance, their outlines progressively fading into a bluish haze due to aerial perspective. Below these ranges, a valley with patches of forest and small bodies of water (lakes or large ponds) is visible. The sky is clear and brightly lit, suggesting a fine, sunny day which enhances visibility across this extensive, undulating terrain.\n\nOverall, the image captures a sense of adventure and exploration, set against a serene and expansive natural environment, likely taken during a hiking or camping expedition. The positioning of the figures, coupled with the scenic background, emphasizes both the scale of the natural surroundings and the human element of interaction with nature.","title":"Backpackers descending the summit of Algonquin Mountain in the High Peaks region of the Adirondack Forest Preserve, second highest point in the New York state.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554503","544305","554508","545768","545700","543385","554509","545762","545751","543378","554507","545781","543510","542751","543382","545772"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiker","expedition","stick","positioning","backpack","camping","hiking","trail","altitude","pond"]}
