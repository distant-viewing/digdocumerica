{"path":"557514.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively camping scene set against a backdrop of rolling hills and lush vegetation. In the foreground, various vehicles and camping equipment are visible: an old-fashioned car with a boxy design and a camper trailer beside it. A bright yellow tent is set up next to the car, and a few other camper trailers are distributed around the area.\n\nSeveral people, appearing relaxed and engaged in leisure activities, populate the scene. Some are situated near a camper trailer, actively participating in what seems to be meal preparation or a casual social gathering. There's a man standing in the background cooking on a grill.\n\nThe environment has a spacious and airy feel, with scattered clumps of trees, bushes, and a notable palm tree that adds to the casual, recreational setting of a campsite. The hills stretching in the background under a clear sky give off a serene rural atmosphere. There are also signs and lampposts visible, indicating that this location is well-facilitated for visitors.","title":"Campers at Refugio State Beach in Santa Barbara County, California, north of Los Angeles. This and other beaches along the coast are heavily used. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increasing land use pressures. Restrictions on coastal development within 1,000 yards of the shoreline were tightened with the passage in November 1972 of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542746","554181","554863","548669","554480","548668","548796","545160","548795","554479","544855","554478","548748","544449","552898","549450"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["camper","trailer","camping","lamppost","campsite","grill","clump","tent","meal","palm"]}
