{"path":"543993.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene, featuring two tall smokestacks prominently in the center, emitting plumes of smoke into the sky. The smokestacks are linked to what appears to be a large industrial facility, likely a power plant, filled with various structures including buildings, tanks, and possible conveyors.\n\nThe foreground shows a rural setting with sparse greenery and small shrubs, indicating the plant is likely on the outskirts of a developed area or in a semi-arid region. The background incorporates a clear blue sky with a few clouds scattered above the horizon, subtly blending with the smoke from the stacks. There are a few power lines and poles visible, suggesting infrastructure for electrical distribution.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the facility centered and the natural landscape in the foreground, underscores the contrast between industrial activity and the natural environment, suggesting a narrative about industry's impact on nature. The image likely dates from the mid to late 20th century, judging by the style of the photograph and the apparent age of the industrial technology shown.","title":"Phelps dodge corp.
