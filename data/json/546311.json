{"path":"546311.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"In the photograph, a man is engaged in the act of examining a sample using a large, complex microscope. The man, wearing a white lab coat and a pink shirt underneath, is intently focused on the process, looking into the microscope's eyepiece. He has dark hair, combed back, and is wearing glasses.\n\nThe microscope appears robust and is predominantly gray, accented with pink components; a setup that indicates a scientific or laboratory environment. On the desk in front of the man, there is a small open case possibly containing another instrument or sample, next to a red pen, highlighting a methodical and precise work environment.\n\nThe background is simple and unobtrusive, featuring light peach-colored walls that help focus attention on the foreground activity. The lighting in the image subtly highlights the concentration and dedication of the man as he performs his task, suggesting a setting of serious scientific inquiry or quality control.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory.
