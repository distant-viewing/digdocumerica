{"path":"551497.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of environmental degradation and waste. In the foreground, partially submerged in murky water, lies an old, rusted vehicleâ€” its structure heavily deteriorated and covered with algae, suggesting it has been abandoned in this water body for a long period. The vehicle appears to be a small military tank or some type of tracked vehicle.\n\nThe background is cluttered with a large accumulation of debris, primarily composed of broken pieces of concrete and discolored, twisted metal parts. The chaotic pile of rubble extends upward toward the top of the photo, indicating significant destruction or demolition that might have taken place in this area. The visible debris suggests that this could be a site of industrial waste, perhaps a demolished structure or a dumping ground for construction materials.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a poignant scene of environmental neglect, highlighting the impact of human activity on natural landscapes. The presence of the discarded vehicle and the extensive rubble in a natural water source is indicative of serious ecological issues, such as pollution and habitat destruction.","title":"A discarded autoMobile engine and concrete blocks from a demolished building have been left along the banks of the Mississippi river","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["555851","555852","549307","555871","551441","551440","555853","547024","546173","555850","544810","555848","546838","556942","547605","550352"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["rubble","destruction","vehicle","waste","demolition","dumping","deteriorate","alga","broken","debris"]}
