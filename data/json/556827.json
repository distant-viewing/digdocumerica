{"path":"556827.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene at a train station platform. Two parallel trains are visible on either side of the platform, with the closest train marked with the number \"8052\" and the word \"Silver.\" Several passengers are engaged in various activities, highlighting the busy and somewhat chaotic nature of travel.\n\nOn the left side of the image, an elderly man in a grey jacket and light-colored pants walks towards the foreground, slightly blurred, suggesting movement. Further down the platform, a woman bends down as she handles her luggage, while a man dressed in a light-colored shirt and dark pants stands nearby, looking toward a train car, possibly boarding it.\n\nIn the center and right side of the image, another group of people adds depth to the scene. A woman, prominently positioned, walks towards the photographer, carrying a patterned bag and dressed in a pink jacket and white trousers. Another woman, carrying trays or boxes stacked on a trolley, heads towards the train, preparing for either unloading or loading supplies.\n\nDominating the right side of the image and engaging the viewer immediately are two young women, one with her arm around the other, seated on a luggage cart. The seated woman, dressed in a blue jacket and jeans, appears thoughtful or tired, gazing out while resting her head on her hand. Her companion, standing and wearing a denim jacket adorned with patches, looks in the same direction, suggesting a shared focus or concern. \n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of transition and movement, underscored by the diverse attire of the travelers and the varied activities taking place. The train station itself, with its industrial features and visible track elements, frames this snapshot of life in transit, embedding the moment in the broader context of railway travel.","title":"Amtrak railroad passengers on their way from the Chicago station to board the Broadway Limited bound for Washington, D.C. and New York City with stops in between. The train leaves Chicago daily at 4 p.m. and arrives in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania at 6:22 a.m. the following day. The train is split at this point with one portion heading for New York and the other for Washington. This train has a history of late arrivals. Amtrak blames the delays on the poor track leased from the nation's railroads.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["555967","556091","556026","556044","556855","556041","556074","556831","556670","555984","555985","556093","556089","556688","555960","556054"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["train","luggage","platform","woman","jacket","travel","station","head","tray","companion"]}
