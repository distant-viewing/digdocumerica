{"path":"552181.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an industrial area situated next to a body of water. The image captures several large industrial facilities including factories, storage tanks, and cargo ships docked at piers.\n\nOn the top left portion of the photo, there is a large factory complex emitting white smoke or steam. This complex includes several large buildings and infrastructures dedicated to industrial or manufacturing processes. Adjacent to this facility, there are additional buildings and structures that contribute to the industrial scene.\n\nIn the center of the image, numerous cylindrical storage tanks are visible, likely used for storing oil, chemicals, or other industrial liquids. These tanks are arranged in several rows, and they vary in size and color, some appearing metallic and others painted in different shades.\n\nThe lower portion of the image shows part of a port area where large cargo ships are moored at the docks. These ships vary in size and are aligned along the quayside. Several cranes and other port machinery can be seen along the docks, indicating active loading or unloading operations.\n\nThe backdrop includes the open water, suggesting this industrial zone is located on the coast or by a large river. The overall tone of the image is somewhat dark, possibly due to the time of day or the photographic settings, enhancing the industrial feel of the scene.","title":"Industrial waterfront of Tacoma.
