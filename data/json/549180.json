{"path":"549180.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph shows a broad, expansive view of a large open field. The terrain is mostly barren with minimal vegetation, primarily composed of dirt and some sparse grass. Tire tracks crisscross the land, suggesting recent vehicle activity. The soil has various shades, from dark browns to lighter tans, indicating different types of earth or stages of excavation. There are distinct layers visible in exposed dug-out sections, possibly from construction or mining.\n\nIn the background, the landscape is more verdant, with a mixture of trees scattered across and a rolling hillside. Beyond, there's a more elevated terrain feature that resembles a flat-topped hill or butte. The sky is overcast, giving the scene a muted lighting which accentuates the raw, earthy tones of the landscape.\n\nThe composition emphasizes the wide expanse of human-altered landscape and contrast between the worked land in the foreground and the natural terrain in the distance.","title":"Old spoil piles are flattened and planted in an attempt at reclamation.
