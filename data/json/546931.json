{"path":"546931.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene on a street with a building and a solitary person. The primary building in the frame is labeled \"Pilgrim Lodge No 1\" in large, visible lettering at the top. Below the building's name, additional text reads \"Pilgrim Lodge Knights of Wise Men Organized 1870,\" suggesting it is a historical or fraternal establishment. The building is a two-story structure with a flat front and an aged appearance, painted in a light color, but showing signs of weathering and disrepair.\n\nIn the foreground and focus of the image is an elderly woman crossing the street, dressed in a light pink dress and matching hat with a patriotic red, white, and blue striped ribbon. She walks barefoot on what appears to be a warm day—as indicated by the clothing and visible greenery—and carries what appears to be a small piece of paper or napkin in her left hand.\n\nThe setting is a basic rural or semi-rural street, evidenced by the lack of sidewalk, the simple road surface, and the ample surrounding greenery. Visible in the background are a few other nondescript buildings or trailers, further contributing to the sense of a modest, perhaps neglected, community area. The overall mood evoked by the image is one of quiet, day-to-day life in a small town or community, highlighted by the timeless snapshot of a local resident in motion.","title":"Typical building in the black community","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["553486","557837","547816","553480","553474","552680","547310","551723","551828","554798","556328","552681","556487","546817","550114","546600"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["street","building","ribbon","community","resident","weathering","establishment","trailer","greenery","disrepair"]}
