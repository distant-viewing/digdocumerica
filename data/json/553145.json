{"path":"553145.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of a busy, possibly rainy, day as multiple people are using umbrellas. The focus is on a woman in the center, who is looking directly at the camera. She has short, styled hair and is wearing a blue coat. Her expression is neutral, and she has an awareness of the camera. Around her, other individuals are using various umbrellas, mostly in shades of red and one transparent. Notably, there's a woman to the left, wearing glasses and a clear plastic rain bonnet over her head, partially covered by her umbrella.\n\nThe setting suggests a crowded outdoor event or a busy street, as suggested by the density of people and umbrellas. The people appear to be of different ages and backgrounds, and everyone is dressed in warm clothing, which implies a cooler weather setting. The diversity of the crowd and the urban-type environment contribute to a vibrant, communal atmosphere, typical of a bustling city scene.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: light rain falls at end of noontime israeli birthday celebration","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["546742","551933","549907","556242","551881","546639","556730","551836","549855","547190","551808","549863","546660","551872","556199","557177"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["umbrella","bonnet","awareness","umbrellas","rainy","people","camera","diversity","woman","rain"]}
