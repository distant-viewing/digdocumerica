{"path":"543203.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic natural setting where two people are near a body of water, which might be a lake or a coastal sea. The foreground of the image is covered in a vibrant carpet of pink flowers, creating a visually striking contrast with the dark, rugged terrain beneath them.\n\nThe middle ground shows two individuals standing on grey, rocky shores at the water's edge. One person is closer to the foreground, looking out towards the water, perhaps contemplating or admiring the view. The other individual, closer to the center-right of the image, stands slightly higher on the rocks and is oriented towards the first person, suggesting a shared experience or interaction.\n\nIn the background, the water of the lake or sea appears calm with a gentle ripple, reflecting the light in soft blues and greys. The composition includes large rocks or boulders that extend into the water, breaking the surface and adding a textural contrast to the smooth appearance of the water.\n\nThe lighting conditions suggest either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the softer, diffused light and long shadows cast across the terrain, enhancing the tranquil and serene mood of the setting. The overall feel of the photo is peaceful and contemplative, with a focus on the beauty and stillness of nature.","title":"California--Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["549471","554002","543199","553396","550826","545229","543601","548833","554477","543951","542994","543505","549716","543535","543248","553135"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["water","grey","sea","contemplate","lake","carpet","softer","rock","boulder","person"]}
