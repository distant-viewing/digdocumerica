{"path":"550111.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a street view that portrays an urban scene with a blend of architectural styles. The road in the foreground has clear, visible lane markings including left turn arrows, directing traffic flow. It looks like a sunny day with a bright blue sky.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a row of buildings of different heights and designs. The most prominent building is relatively large and made of what appears to be gray stone, positioned directly on the corner of an intersection. Adjacent to it is a modernist, white building with a plain design.\n\nThe right side of the street features smaller buildings with traditional designs that include elements such as gabled roofs and shutters, giving them a residential or small-town commercial appearance. One of these buildings has an advertisement on its side facing the street, suggestive of a local business. These structures have a classic American architectural style, suggesting a historic district or a preservation area.\n\nThe streets are notably devoid of heavy traffic but include a couple of parked cars and an individual walking, possibly indicating a quiet, less congested time of day or a less busy area of town. \n\nOverhead, utility wires stretch across the street, a common feature in many American cityscapes, and several streetlights can also be seen along the sidewalks.","title":"'Bonne Bell Cosmetics' restoration program transformed a decaying business section of suburban Lakewood into this attractive \"Georgetown Row\" of shops'","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["553301","550107","545333","542900","546745","551474","555450","546440","546428","545498","550024","557805","558030","556983","557272","545610"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["street","town","design","traffic","walking","streetlight","building","arrow","preservation","turn"]}
