{"path":"545940.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene featuring a large body of calm water, likely a lake or a calm bay, reflecting the clear, blue sky above. In the foreground, there is a makeshift structure built somewhat like a raft or floating platform, constructed from piping and netting materials, suggesting a possible use for aquaculture or simple docking.\n\nA man is present on the platform, engaging in some sort of activity that involves crouching down, possibly adjusting or inspecting the structure or equipment on the platform. He is dressed casually, in a t-shirt and trousers suitable for physical, outdoor work.\n\nThe surrounding setting appears serene and wide open, with the body of water extending towards a low horizon line where distant hills or mountains faintly outline the background. The surface of the water is smooth, indicating calm weather conditions. There are no other people or boats visible in the immediate vicinity, creating a sense of solitude and peacefulness.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on a single human figure within a vast landscape, evokes themes of isolation and interaction with nature.","title":"Truckee river","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["550268","555602","549012","545932","546293","545936","545922","550826","548030","545926","542556","550217","545928","548034","545915","553082"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["platform","netting","aquaculture","raft","docking","crouch","piping","peacefulness","inspect","t"]}
