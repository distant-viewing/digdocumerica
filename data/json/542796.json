{"path":"542796.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene evening scene at a coastal location. The main focal point is a silhouette of a lighthouse on the left side of the image, standing on what appears to be a headland overlooking the sea. The lighthouse, distinguished by its classic tiered structure and a small light on top, stands against a fading twilight sky showing shades of pink, blue, and dark blue, transitioning into night.\n\nThe horizon line cuts across the middle of the composition where the dark blue sea meets the sky. No strong waves are visible, suggesting calm sea conditions. To the right of the lighthouse, there are utility poles lined up, contributing to the sense of rural or semi-rural environment. This side also includes a smaller building, possibly related to the lighthouse operations.\n\nThe overall lighting of the photograph is dim, indicating that it was taken during dusk. The subtle illumination helps emphasize the outlines of the lighthouse and the utility poles. The ground in the foreground is not clearly visible but appears to be rugged and natural, typical of coastal landscapes.\n\nAbove the horizon, the sky gradually darkens as it stretches upward, while the lower sky is still capturing the last light of the day. This timing, along with the unobtrusive human-made structures, emphasizes a quiet and tranquil mood, typical of many natural coastal settings during evening times.","title":"California--northern coast","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550361","543141","550314","550362","549375","546151","543086","547561","544996","545030","547483","547131","545000","557508","547110","547916"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["lighthouse","utility","evening","timing","pole","sea","illumination","night","horizon","twilight"]}
