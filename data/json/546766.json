{"path":"546766.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling shipyard scene centered on the launching of a large vessel named \"Chevron Hawaii.\" The ship, painted red with black and blue detailing at the bow, dominates the frame. It is positioned between two towering gantry cranes on either side, which are essential equipment for shipbuilding and repair tasks.\n\nIn the foreground, several workers in hard hats observe the event, indicating the significance and scale of the operation. Some of the workers are standing and conversing, while others appear to be inspecting the work or surveying the scene. The industrial feel is enhanced by various metal components and debris scattered around the work area.\n\nOverall, the scene is a dynamic display of industrial activity, focusing on maritime engineering and teamwork in a shipyard. The cloudy sky and the broad daylight set the time and weather conditions, contributing to the gritty, work-intensive atmosphere of the photograph.","title":"\"chevron Hawaii\" is launched from sparrows point shipyard the construction of oil tankers is a major source of employment for Baltimore workers","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546843","546016","546909","546919","545147","546867","552149","552148","555797","555796","551997","548125","546033","546802","549590","547474"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["shipyard","worker","work","survey","teamwork","tasnks","bow","detailing","repair","engineering"]}
