{"path":"549673.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a candid interaction between a man and a woman on a city street. The composition is vibrant and includes various urban elements.\n\n**People:** There are two main subjects. The man appears to be middle-aged, wearing a white shirt tucked into light-colored trousers, and leaning casually against a car. He demonstrates a relaxed posture, one arm resting on the open door of the car and the other extended in a gesture as he talks to the woman. The woman, appearing younger, is dressed in a formal, navy-blue ensemble with a knee-length skirt, blazer, and a white sailor-style cap. She carries a handbag and listens to the man, standing with her arms casually at her sides.\n\n**Environment:** They are situated at the entrance or exit of a pedestrian zone, as indicated by a sign reading \"Fußgängerzone Ende\" which translates to \"End of pedestrian zone\" in English. The background shows urban signage and advertisements, including a sign for \"Hafenbad\" and another mysterious advertisement featuring a stylized human figure.\n\n**Vehicles and Objects:** A pale-colored car, possibly silver or light blue, is partially visible, framing the man leaning on it. It appears to be a sedan from around the 1970s.\n\n**Overall Scene:** The scene is set on a paved road marked with traffic lines, typical of city settings. While this photo seems to be from the 1970s or 80s, based on the style of clothes and the car model, the image encapsulates a natural moment of conversation and exchange in an everyday urban environment, highlighted by the city elements and relaxed demeanors of the individuals involved. The composition effectively draws attention to the interpersonal exchange against a backdrop of city life.","title":"Vienna's pedestrian-only zones are guarded by police women.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["549925","549324","557863","551462","551835","551854","554178","551742","551454","551829","550967","557909","547834","555944","549851","550082"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["exchange","city","advertisement","car","pedestrian","zone","arm","80","woman","lean"]}
