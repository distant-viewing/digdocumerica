{"path":"554885.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene set in a natural, rural environment, likely on a sunny day given the bright lighting and shadows observed. The image prominently features two individuals, each riding a horse. The person on the left steers their horse while also holding another horse by a lead. The second individual, riding on the right, is posed looking slightly towards the camera. Both riders wear cowboy hats, suggesting a Western setting, and appear to be engaged in a herding or ranching activity.\n\nIn front of the riders, a group of sheep with prominent black faces and legs, likely of a breed such as Suffolk or a similar variety, are grazing or moving through the underbrush. The vegetation around them includes a range of shrubs and small trees with green leaves, indicating a fertile environment.\n\nThe background of the scene is composed of more dense greenery, with trees that have thicker foliage, and rolling hills can be faintly seen through the haze in the distance, adding a sense of depth to the landscape. The overall composition of the photograph, with its elements of wildlife, livestock, and human activity, suggests a harmonious interaction between humans and nature in a pastoral or ranch setting.","title":"Member of a Leakey, Texas, area ranch family rounds up sheep from horseback near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554128","553105","552698","552562","552573","554129","543634","552565","553104","553102","543779","543776","557988","543366","548828","553109"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["horse","rider","ranching","breed","underbrush","ranch","sheep","livestock","wildlife","leg"]}
