{"path":"553437.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a person enjoying a playful moment outdoors, swinging from a rope above a serene body of water. The person is suspended in mid-air, holding onto a knotted rope swing that is attached to an unseen point off-camera. They appear to be in the process of swinging out over the water, likely preparing for a splash landing.\n\nThe backdrop is a dense arrangement of verdant green trees, reflecting a thick woodland area. The trees are lush, suggesting the season is either late spring or summer. The water beneath the swing is calm, with a slight ripple effect around the areas closest to the swinging rope, indicating recent movement.\n\nThe lighting in this scene suggests it is a bright, possibly sunny day, although the exact position of the sun is not visible. The overall mood of the image is adventurous and carefree, capturing a quintessential summer activity that combines nature, excitement, and a hint of risk.","title":"This favorite spot for swimming in the Squannacook River is located near Groton in the Town Forest Preserve.
