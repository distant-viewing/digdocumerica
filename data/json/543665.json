{"path":"543665.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a panoramic view of a vast, rugged landscape from an elevated vantage point. The terrain is uneven and predominantly covered with sparse vegetation that includes small bushes and scrubland. The area is dotted with numerous small rocks and patches of bare soil, suggesting a dry or arid climate.\n\nIn the foreground, a prominent curved line, possibly a road or trail, snakes through the landscape. Alongside the road, there is a small body of water reflecting a bit of the sky, bordered by darker terrain that could be wet mud or dense vegetation.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo is dominated by the rocky and rough terrain that extends into the distance. In the background, the terrain rises gently into hills and low mountains, which are slightly obscured by a blue or hazy atmospheric quality, suggesting distance and scale.\n\nThe overall lighting in the photo appears to be natural, with shadows indicating that the sun is either setting or rising, which aids in accentuating the textures and contours of the landscape. The sky above is barely visible but appears clear. The composition of the photograph, with its wide scope and the winding line leading the viewer's eye through the frame, conveys a sense of untouched wilderness.","title":"Aerial of electric power plant","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["550598","549179","544027","545783","544016","549016","555642","552906","544745","544155","550397","545761","550596","545895","545604","543772"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["terrain","scope","snake","mud","trail","line","road","contour","vantage","distance"]}
