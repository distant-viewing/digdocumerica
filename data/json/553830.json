{"path":"553830.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a series of high-voltage transmission towers receding into the distance against a twilight or dusk sky. These towers are silhouetted and appear prominently due to their intricate structural patterns made of interconnected metal beams. Each tower supports multiple overhead power lines that sag gently between them, tracing curved lines across the sky.\n\nThe scene is backlit by a fading evening light, which creates a gradation of colors in the sky, transitioning from a warm, golden hue at the horizon to deeper blues and purples as the sky arches overhead. In the background, silhouettes of mountains or distant hills define the horizon, adding a sense of depth and scale.\n\nThe photograph conveys a sense of industrial scale and the integration of human-made structures within a natural landscape at the edge of day. The lighting condition casts a somewhat dramatic and serene mood, emphasizing the contours and geometry of the transmission towers. The overall composition emphasizes vertical and diagonal lines created by the towers and the power lines, drawing the viewerâ€™s eye through the image toward the horizon.","title":"Powerlines near Searchlight, Nevada (from the sites exhibition.
