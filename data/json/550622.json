{"path":"550622.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a meandering river that snakes through a densely wooded area. The river appears wide and reflective, suggesting it might be a significant water body. The banks of the river show some signs of erosion, as sections of the riverbank are exposed without vegetation, revealing lighter-colored earth or sand.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is thickly forested, predominantly with dark green trees which could be a mix of coniferous and deciduous types. The photograph is taken from a high vantage point, providing a wide view of the river's course as well as the expansive forest surrounding it. In the distance, the horizon fades into a lighter blue, possibly indicating either a distant body of water, a vast open sky, or lighter terrain.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or structures; the area appears remote and untouched. The lighting in the image suggests it may be taken either in the early morning or late afternoon, as the sunlight softens the colors of the landscape and creates a slightly muted, serene atmosphere. The overall composition and perspective emphasize the natural beauty and serenity of this wilderness area.","title":"Looking eastward at the tazlina river crossing of the pipeline route","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550527","550625","550616","550571","553452","550576","557002","550559","542909","550580","550542","550621","550581","550570","550531","550620"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","course","serenity","soften","snake","fade","meander","erosion","surrounding","forested"]}
