{"path":"554987.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image features a close-up view of a cluster of pine cones. The pine cones are tightly packed together, showing overlapping scales with pointy tips. The color palette consists mostly of deep browns and muted pale tones, which could suggest maturity or aging of the cones. The texture of these cones is prominently displayed; the scales are woody and appear rough, with white and pale yellow edges that may indicate drying or exposure to the elements.\n\nThe lighting is dim with shadows casting over parts of the pine cones, which highlights the textures and creates a somewhat moody or mysterious atmosphere. The background is out of focus and very dark, directing the viewer's full attention to the intricate details and textures of the pine cones themselves. This presentation portrays not only the physical characteristics of the pine cones but also a sense of the quiet, still environment in which they might be found.","title":"Douglas fir cone details in the Olympic National Park Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557542","554988","555003","555194","555099","557607","549226","557169","555004","557592","557620","555108","542774","557020","555016","557602"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["cone","maturity","texture","presentation","tip","scale","characteristic","aging","exposure","cluster"]}
