{"path":"547290.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a whimsical rural scene featuring a quirky mailbox stand by a roadside. The stand, painted bright red, is shaped like a cartoon-style cow standing upright. The cow, which has a white face and underbelly, appears to be chasing the blue mailbox held in its extended hands. There's a playful expression on the cow's face, making the mailbox seem as though itâ€™s part of a chase. Above the mailbox, attached to a wooden post, there's a small sign that reads \"Wynmore Rural Fire Dist. 444,\" indicating the mailbox likely belongs to a property in the Wynmore Rural Fire District.\n\nThe background shows a rural setting with a long road stretching into the distance. Alongside the road, a vehicle is approaching, suggesting movement and life in this otherwise serene landscape. The grass along the roadside is lush and green, suggesting it's either spring or summer. In the distance, the terrain gently slopes upwards, dotted with houses and trees, typical of a rural landscape.\n\nThe bright, clear sky indicates it's a sunny day, contributing to the visibility and vibrant colors in the scene. Overall, the composition blends functionality with creativity, offering a glimpse into countryside life and the personality of its residents.","title":"On Highway 77, south of Wymore","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547296","549006","557760","552468","557759","542702","556984","557566","549005","555635","544492","557950","550019","552476","554132","549257"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["mailbox","cow","stand","roadside","cartoon","creativity","face","countryside","resident","functionality"]}
