{"path":"551061.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a landscape under a dramatic sky filled with textured clouds. The scene is likely taken in the early evening as implied by the dim natural light and shadowed areas. In the foreground, a residential area with clusters of houses dotted among trees can be seen, forming a comfortable suburban setting.\n\nAs the eye moves to the middle ground, the landscape gives way to an industrial scene highlighted by factories and a large chimney from which a significant plume of smoke or pollution rises vertically. This thick, conspicuous smoke is a strong visual element, contrasting with the otherwise naturally toned setting.\n\nIn the background, gentle hills or mountains line the horizon, enclosing the scene and adding a sense of depth and isolation to the area. The mountains are partially obscured by haze, possibly due to the atmospheric conditions or the pollution implied by the smoke.\n\nOverall, the composition creates a visual narrative contrasting human habitation and industry against a natural backdrop, underscored by environmental themes. The color palette leans towards cooler tones with the darkened landscape and the purplish hue of twilight, contributing to the somewhat somber atmosphere of the image.","title":"Looking down the kanawha river valley from deepwater toward Alloy where union carbide's ferroAlloy plant pollutes the early evening air","placename":"Charleston (W.
