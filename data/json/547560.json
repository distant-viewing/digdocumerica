{"path":"547560.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of people on a boat, captured during a low-light condition, likely either dawn or dusk. The people are seated in a long, narrow boat that is afloat on calm waters. Each individual is wearing matching attire, possibly for a specific activity related to the water, such as rowing or perhaps a guided tour. Their outfits include yellow jackets, suggesting a uniform or protective gear, likely for visibility and safety.\n\nThe boat they are in appears somewhat old and utilitarian, possibly a traditional wooden boat, and it is slightly crowded with every seat occupied. The water around the boat has gentle ripples, indicating slight movement either from the boat itself or a mild breeze.\n\nThe background is soft and lacks detailed features, possibly due to the mist or fog which blends the water with the skyline. There are no distinct landmarks visible, and the overall atmosphere is serene, with the main source of color being the yellow jackets contrasted against the generally muted tones of the surroundings. The lighting casts a gentle glow on the scene, enhancing the tranquil and somewhat mysterious ambiance of the photograph.","title":"Fishing dories close in on traps.
