{"path":"551201.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an industrial area situated along a river. The facility appears to be a large plant, possibly a steel mill or some other heavy manufacturing facility, featuring several large buildings with tall smokestacks, from which white smoke is emitting. Adjacent to the plant are open areas piled with materials, which might be raw ores or coal, indicating the industrial nature of the operations.\n\nThe river bends around the plant, and there are docks visible along the water, suggesting that the facility might use the river for transporting goods or raw materials. A noticeable feature in the river is a barge, which is moving near the shoreline.\n\nOn the plant's periphery, there is a railway line running parallel to the river, enhancing the logistical capabilities of the facility with rail transportation. Along this railway, multiple railroad cars are stationed, likely for loading or unloading materials.\n\nThe surrounding area is lush with greenery, with forests encroaching close to the industrial activity. To the far side of the river opposite the plant, there is a more serene setting with what appears to be a small residential area amidst the trees, starkly contrasting the industrial foreground. The sky above is clear, suggesting bright, sunny weather conditions which enhance the visibility in the image.","title":"Cabin creek power plant is the oldest in the Appalachian system","placename":"Charleston (W.
