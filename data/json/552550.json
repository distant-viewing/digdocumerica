{"path":"552550.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic and serene natural landscape, primarily featuring the remnants of a collapsed wooden log structure in a grassy field. The structure, possibly an old corral or fence, is made of rough, weathered logs that appear strewn about in disarray, some still retaining their original positions as part of the wall formations. The grass around is lush and green, suggesting a location well-watered and fertile, possibly in a mountainous or rural area.\n\nIn the background, the scene is framed by a dense forest of tall, slender trees, likely aspens given their white barks and the leafy green canopy. The forest appears to extend up into a gently sloping hill or low mountain. The sky overhead is overcast, with heavy, dark clouds suggesting an imminent storm or recent rainfall, adding a dramatic and moody tone to the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph captures a juxtaposition of natural beauty and the remnants of human activity, conveying a sense of quiet abandonment and the resilience of nature reclaiming its space.","title":"Abandoned Homestead in a valley in piceance basin","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552515","543122","551111","547522","557997","554561","547518","555151","551329","555207","543339","549156","552673","547514","542611","544468"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["remnant","log","reclaim","retain","collapse","disarray","overhead","forest","storm","rainfall"]}
