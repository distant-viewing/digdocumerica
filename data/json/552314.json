{"path":"552314.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph portrays a serene and evocative scene of a person fishing in a body of water during twilight or dawn, creating a silhouette effect. In the foreground, a figure stands waist-deep in the water, holding a raised fishing rod that arcs gracefully into the air. The silhouette of the individual is centered in the composition, and the subdued lighting emphasizes the tranquility and isolated nature of the activity.\n\nTo the right, a large, densely foliaged tree sharply contrasts against the lighter sky, further framing the person in the scene. The background features a soft skyline where the silhouettes of distant hills or landforms are just visible against the sky, hinting at a tranquil lakeside or riverside setting.\n\nThe overall lighting of the scene is dim, suggesting the sun is either rising or setting, with the resulting light diffusing through a hazy sky. This imbues the scene with a calm, contemplative atmosphere. The water surface glistens subtly with reflections of the faint light, enhancing the peaceful and introspective mood of the photograph.","title":"Fly fisherman angling for sea run cutthroat trout in puget sound near marysville","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552224","543753","552309","550217","550666","554147","542651","549933","557565","552308","543628","550313","551280","555576","551024","543659"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["silhouette","deep","arc","waist","imbue","landform","lakeside","result","glisten","riverside"]}
