{"path":"550569.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a lush, expansive landscape dominated by natural features. The image shows a vast expanse of greenery, punctuated by numerous small lakes and wetlands reflecting the sky, creating a mosaic of water bodies sprawled throughout the terrain. The largest of these bodies of water forms a winding, river-like feature flowing through the landscape, encased by dense patches of forest and open grassy areas.\n\nThe terrain itself is varied, with flat plains transitioning into gentle rolling hills. The landscape is predominantly covered in dense, dark green vegetation, likely a mix of forested areas and smaller bushes, indicating a terrain rich in biodiversity. This natural setting appears remote and untouched by urban development, emphasizing its pristine and tranquil character.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken either early in the morning or late in the afternoon, as the light is soft and the colors are deeply saturated. The clouds casting shadows over parts of the landscape add a dynamic contrast and depth to the aerial view. Overall, the photograph portrays a serene, untouched natural environment, likely captured to emphasize the beauty and vastness of this ecological area.","title":"Typical lakes and marshy lowlands south of the yukon river","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550644","550544","556926","550643","550617","550541","558046","550578","554652","550601","557107","550629","545114","556906","544649","556931"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["terrain","mosaic","encase","plain","biodiversity","forest","sprawl","punctuate","landscape","wetland"]}
