{"path":"550957.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph features a bustling industrial scene characterized by large-scale infrastructure. The focus is on a complex of tall smokestacks, several of which are actively emitting smoke, indicative of ongoing industrial operations. The structures, varying in height and grouped tightly together, are part of a larger factory setup with an array of interconnected buildings and metal constructs that include piping, machinery, and various other industrial apparatus.\n\nIn the foreground, the scene is viewed from a body of water, possibly a river, as evidenced by sparkling reflections suggestive of sunlight hitting the surface. On this river, a barge labeled \"FMC CO\" is visible, hinting at commercial or logistical activities linked to the factory's function. The barge appears laden with containers or cargo, integral to the operations occurring in the background.\n\nThe overall color palette of the image leans towards darker and muted tones, reflecting an overcast sky and the gritty reality of industrial zones. The atmosphere is further underlined by the apparent pollution emanating from the factory, contributing to a sense of environmental impact.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment in the life of an industrial area, emphasizing functional architecture and the processing activities pivotal to its existence. The presence of the barge introduces a dynamic element, suggesting the movement and exchange integral to such settings.","title":"The FMC Corporation's South Charleston plant","placename":"Charleston (W.
