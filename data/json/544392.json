{"path":"544392.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic and rugged landscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and blue tones dominating the scene. In the foreground, a scattering of large, rounded boulders covers the ground, creating a rough and uneven terrain. The middle ground is marked by gently sloping hills that extend into the distance, adorned sporadically with small, sparse trees.\n\nDominating the center of the composition is a striking rock formation, which rises majestically against the skyline. This formation features several sharp peaks and steep cliff faces, suggesting a mountain or large hill of considerable geological significance. The silhouette of this formation is outlined against a lighter sky, which subtly fades from a deep blue at the top to a lighter, perhaps slightly pinkish hue near the horizon, indicating the low light conditions of early morning or late evening.\n\nOn the right side and in the distance, additional rock formations with jagged outlines can be seen, adding depth and emphasizing the wild, untouched nature of the landscape. These formations appear smaller and contribute to the layering of the scene, enhancing the perception of vast, open space.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of solitude and the raw beauty of a natural, undeveloped environment. The absence of any human presence or artificial structures reinforces the timeless and enduring quality of the landscape.","title":"The Shiprock at dawn","placename":"Shiprock (N.M.)","location":"Shiprock, New Mexico","nn1":["550428","545805","545761","544745","545775","544363","545791","544376","545801","545783","552444","555592","544429","545696","544359","543838"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["formation","scattering","layering","rock","boulder","hill","significance","absence","distance","cliff"]}
