{"path":"553316.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This is a vibrant and busy outdoor photograph depicting an orchestral event. The scene shows the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra performing under a large tent-like structure that prominently displays the text \"CINCINNATI SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\" on its side. The event seems to be part of a special occurrence titled \"SYMPHONY WEEK,\" as indicated by banners hanging around the tent and atop the adjacent modern concrete buildings.\n\nThe setting is outdoor, likely in an urban park or plaza, as suggested by the presence of small trees, bench seating, and paved grounds. The audience is large, with several hundred people gathered around the orchestra tent, and more approaching from the peripheries. The crowd is diverse in age and gender, generally dressed in casual summer attire, which includes shorts, t-shirts, summer dresses, and hats, indicating the event occurs during warm weather.\n\nThe backdrop features a couple of modern, brutalist-style buildings, giving it an institutional or civic center feel. The crowd's attention is mostly focused towards the orchestra, and many people stand while others make their way towards the performance area, suggesting a free, informal event atmosphere conducive to enjoying live classical music outdoors. The photograph captures a communal cultural event, emphasizing a shared interest in music and community gatherings.","title":"Noon concert by Cincinnati symphony orchestra in fountain square.
