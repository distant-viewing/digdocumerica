{"path":"544598.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic yet dramatic landscape centered on a highway stretching into the distance. The highway features a single lane in each direction, divided by a double yellow line, typical of rural or less-traveled roads. The road is flanked on the left by a long row of tall trees with dense, dark foliage, which leans slightly over the road, adding a sense of shelter and depth to the scene.\n\nOn the right side, there's an open landscape comprised of sparse, low-lying vegetation and a few scattered trees, indicative of a flat, possibly coastal or prairie-like environment. This area is bordered by grass and irregular wild shrubs, presenting a stark contrast to the orderly line of trees on the opposite side. A safety barrier runs along the left side of the road, suggesting a concern for safety in this potentially secluded area.\n\nThe sky above is imposing, with dense, stormy clouds suggesting an impending storm, adding a moody and dramatic tone to the setting. The clouds are dark and voluminous, covering most of the sky and casting a shadow over the landscape, which enhances the contrasting light in the scene.\n\nThis environment, with its contrasting elements of shelter by the trees and exposure in the open field, set under a looming stormy sky, evokes a sense of solitude and perhaps anticipation, as the road leads the viewer's eye towards the horizon and into the unknown. The overall atmosphere is evocative of change, suggesting a narrative of journey and encounter with the natural elements.","title":"U.S. 41","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544490","544645","545367","554127","544116","547659","554566","554130","553785","551240","544043","554131","549002","556405","547354","553127"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["road","shelter","highway","safety","prairie","anticipation","run","journey","storm","tree"]}
