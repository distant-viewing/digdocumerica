One of these pipes is cut open, showing its interior. There are several other construction materials and debris scattered around the site. In the background, there is a partial view of urban infrastructure including a few high-rise buildings, suggesting that the site is located near or within a city.\n\nOn the left, a figure can be seen standing on the edge of the site, appearing to be overseeing the area or perhaps ready to perform some work. The sky is overcast, giving the scene a slightly bleak and gritty ambiance. The general atmosphere suggests an active construction area, possibly related to utility or infrastructure development.","title":"Sewer pipe for new water pollution control plant in Jamaica Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557387","557388","549204","548431","545615","544153","548932","547948","544167","547571","554426","543170","551983","545070","553453","552003"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["site","construction","pipe","infrastructure","tube","interior","rise","utility","development","figure"]}
