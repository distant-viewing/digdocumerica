{"path":"550768.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric scene of people canoeing on a calm river surrounded by lush forest. The image is viewed through a natural frame of blurred foliage in the foreground, highlighting a focus on the peaceful water activity in the center.\n\nTwo canoes, each holding two people, are featured in the middle of the image. Both canoes are paddling gently, creating small ripples in the shimmering water that reflect fragments of dusky light. The individuals appear to be engaged in a leisurely paddle, possibly conversing or quietly enjoying the natural scenery.\n\nThe river is wide and tranquil, bordered by a dense canopy of trees that are rich in shades of dark green. The background shows more trees that line the riverbank, contributing to a sense of seclusion and a natural, untouched environment.\n\nOverall, the mood of the photograph is peaceful and contemplative, emphasizing the beauty and calm of a riverside forest retreat. The color palette consists of deep greens, blues, and subtle hints of lavender in the water, enhancing the overall tranquil and slightly mysterious atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Paddling down the Wisconsin River from Tower Hill State Park, two canoes and seven men retrace the 3000-mile trip made in 1673 by Father Marquette and Louis Joliet, clothes and canoes duplicate those of the first explorers.
