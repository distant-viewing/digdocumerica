{"path":"555521.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat chaotic and cluttered industrial scene. The foreground is dominated by a large accumulation of various-sized tires, piled up haphazardly. Beyond the tires, there are scattered pieces of debris, including wooden planks, sheets of metal, and smaller rubble. The ground appears to be concrete, with patches of it broken and uneven.\n\nIn the middle ground, there are several garage-like structures with large openings, possibly bays for vehicle maintenance or storage. The structures have features such as stone facades and distinctive architectural designs, suggesting a commercial or industrial complex.\n\nThe background includes additional industrial elements, such as cargo containers and trucks, hinting at an active working area. There are also trees and a distant landscape that suggest this site is on the outskirts of a town or in a semi-urban area.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the scene conveys a sense of abandonment or recent upheaval, possibly after a clear-out or an event that left the area in disarray. The cloudy sky adds to the gloomy, neglected feel of the image.","title":"A recently built gas station, had no fuel allocation and was closed, then moved from a busy intersection during the gasoline crisis of 1973-74.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["547470","549773","549776","546913","542531","556324","547901","549307","545059","550264","556640","550265","554356","546893","547777","556323"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["tire","disarray","rubble","sheet","garage","accumulation","outskirt","opening","cargo","plank"]}
