{"path":"555916.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph depicts a young, shirtless man with dark hair, who is playing baseball in a park-like setting. He is captured in a dynamic pose with his arms raised over his head, holding a wooden baseball bat with both hands in a swinging motion. His expression is one of focus and effort, visible through his open mouth and engaged gaze, suggesting he is either about to hit a pitched ball or has just finished a swing.\n\nThe setting shows an expanse of green grass indicating an outdoor area, likely a park. In the blurred background, a few details hint at other park visitors and possibly small trees or bushes, but these elements are not sharply defined. The lighting is natural, likely from daylight, contributing to the vividness of the green grass and highlighting the muscles and contours of the man's torso.\n\nThe man is wearing patterned shorts, and his physique is lean and muscular, emphasizing his active engagement in the sport. Overall, the photograph captures a moment of athletic exertion and youthful vitality in an outdoor, recreational setting.","title":"Boy at bat in a softball game in Hiland Park of Brooklyn, New York City. The inner city today is an absolute contradiction to the mainstream America of gas stations, expressways, shopping centers, and tract homes. It is populated by Blacks, Latins, and the white poor. This project is a portrait of the inner city environment. It contains architecture and the residents enjoying themselves.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556507","550078","549318","555915","546272","548578","556303","556302","551973","553042","555921","552024","552109","551721","551289","556583"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["baseball","exertion","torso","vitality","park","swing","hit","ball","finish","pitch"]}
