{"path":"558325.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"In the photograph, an older man is seated at a large, traditional wooden weaving loom in a room that appears to be a dedicated workspace. The man has grey hair and is dressed in a light blue shirt with suspenders. He is actively engaged in the process of weaving, holding and manipulating bundles of yarn or fabric with both hands.\n\nThe loom is substantial, constructed of wood and complex in structure, with various beams, shafts, and a series of warp threads stretched vertically on it. There's a cranking mechanism seen on the side of the loom, likely used to adjust the tension or alignment of the weave.\n\nAround the loom, the room is simply adorned. A baseboard heater lines the wall under a large window that fills the room with natural daylight, highlighting the lush greenery visible outside. There's also a plain cardboard box on the floor labeled \"pleas,\" along with another element that looks like a small black bag. The flooring is a simple, pale patterned tile that complements the mostly neutral colors of the room.","title":"Older citizens, retired persons and those unable to care for themselves physically are cared for in two community centers.
