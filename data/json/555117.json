{"path":"555117.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image captures a dense stand of slender, tall trees that appear to be of a mixed variety, predominantly coniferous, in a forest setting. The trees have thin trunks, tightly grouped, with some bearing what looks like peeling bark, suggesting they could be types of birches or similar species. The canopy is not visible in the image, emphasizing the verticality and closeness of the trunks which create a pattern of vertical lines across the frame.\n\nThe color tone is cool, with the colors ranging from dark browns to greys and hints of bluish hues, likely due to the light or photographic filter used. The forest floor is barely visible but appears to be covered with fallen branches, twigs, and possibly some dead leaves, indicating a natural and undisturbed woodland.\n\nThere is a noticeable absence of undergrowth except for a few fern-like plants at the bottom right of the photograph, which add a slight contrast to the monotony of the tree trunks. The mood conveyed by this image is somewhat eerie and isolated, emphasizing the dense and possibly untamed nature of this forest region. The overall composition invokes a sense of enclosure, characteristic of thick, unbroken forest areas where light filters minimally through the dense canopy above.","title":"Stagnating Douglas fir trees in need of thinning in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555121","553574","542725","555201","546947","555114","555128","543487","555096","555122","554990","555118","554976","553579","555125","555112"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["trunk","forest","canopy","filter","monotony","birch","verticality","closeness","enclosure","fern"]}
