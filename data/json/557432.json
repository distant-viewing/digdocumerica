{"path":"557432.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a serene, yet somewhat melancholic suburban landscape. The scene is centered around a long, bending road flanked by tall, thin trees which line the left side of the road, emphasizing its curve and length. The road is mostly empty except for one individual, a cyclist, who rides along it, clad in casual attire and moving away from the viewpoint of the camera.\n\nOn the right side of the road, the landscape gradually steps down through several tiers of residential housing. The houses appear modest and closely packed, with flat roofs and similar architectural designs, possibly indicating a planned community or development. In the distance beyond the houses, there is a wide, open field which gives way to a row of trees and undergrowth that separate the residential area from another vaguely visible development in the distant background. \n\nThe background also features a glimpse of larger buildings, hinting at a more urban setting beyond the immediate residential zone. The sky is slightly overcast, casting a diffuse light over the entire scene and muting the colors, thus adding to the tranquil yet somber ambiance of the photograph. \n\nOverall, the composition and elements of the picture—from the solitary figure on the bike to the orderly housing and expansive landscapes—create a sense of solitude and the daily rhythm of life in a suburban setting.","title":"Spyglass homes built on a terraced hillside give a good view of the harbor","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["547388","546545","550073","545372","558139","545538","557990","547567","558131","547389","546430","547354","547433","547659","546956","556448"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["housing","road","mut","cyclist","rhythm","development","tier","bike","designs","undergrowth"]}
