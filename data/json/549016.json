{"path":"549016.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a broad, expansive aerial view of a rugged landscape predominantly characterized by arid, barren terrains with undulating hills and mountains. The range of colors in the terrain varies from pale beige to deeper browns, signifying a desert or semi-desert environment. A notable feature in this rough terrain is a winding asphalt road that cuts through the hills, clearly visible as it snakes through the valleys, creating a contrast with the surrounding land.\n\nIn the center of the image lies a splash of lush greenery, a stark contrast to the sandy tones of the surrounding desert. This verdant area appears to be an oasis or possibly agricultural land situated around a water body—a river or a stream—which can be inferred from the dark, snaking patches that run through the green area. No buildings or other structures are visible, giving the impression of a relatively untouched or sparsely inhabited area.\n\nThe background shows more mountainous formations, which fade into the horizon under a sky that looks a bit hazy, possibly due to dust or the time of day, with no discernible cloud cover, enhancing the aridity of the landscape. This kind of terrain could be typical of regions like those found in certain parts of the Middle East, North Africa, or the American Southwest.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the vastness and solitude of a desert environment intersected by human infrastructure, offering a glimpse into both the natural world's stark beauty and the ways in which landscapes are traversed and utilized.","title":"Las vegas wash carries Las Vegas sewage out to lake mead","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["545575","544016","542518","543665","545604","544027","552923","555873","545895","550397","544400","544428","549179","545329","542511","542838"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["desert","snake","terrain","oasis","infer","traverse","land","asphalt","beige","signify"]}
