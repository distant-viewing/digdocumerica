{"path":"549351.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of three people engaged in an activity on a boat against a vast ocean backdrop. The central figure, a shirtless man wearing white pants, is actively handling a cylindrical object attached to a rope, appearing to be either deploying or retrieving it from the sea. He is leaning over the side of the boat and shows a focused expression on his activity.\n\nTo his right, there's another man observing the process closely. He is also shirtless and wears sunglasses; his posture suggests he might be assisting or ready to assist.\n\nStanding beside him is a woman, dressed in a striped tank top and white shorts. She is watching the activity with interest, standing close to the boat's edge.\n\nThe deck of the boat appears worn and stained, indicative of frequent use. Visible in the background is the calm ocean extending to the horizon under a clear sky. The equipment and activity suggest some form of marine research or exploration.","title":"Zoology students from the University of Vienna participate in a scientific cruise of the Adriatic Sea aboard the research ship the Vila Velebita II.
