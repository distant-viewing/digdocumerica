{"path":"556585.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph provides a panoramic view of a small valley town nestled among lush, green hills. In the foreground, a set of railroad tracks curves alongside a road that passes under a bridge. This scene creates a sense of depth and connection within the town.\n\nHouses are densely packed into the landscape, varying in color and architectural style, largely appearing to be residential single-family homes. Some houses have visible gardens or small yards, adding specks of greenery that complement the surrounding vegetation.\n\nTo the left, the homes are more sporadically placed on the hillside, and there are some larger buildings, perhaps functionally different from the smaller homes, like community buildings or larger residential complexes.\n\nIn the background, the dense trees on the hillside emphasize the rural setting of the town. There is no clear indication of heavy industrial activity; the community seems primarily residential or possibly small-scale commercial. The entire composition presents a tranquil small-town atmosphere with nature integrated closely into the residential areas. Additionally, the image has an overcast look, suggesting either early morning or an impending storm, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene.","title":"View of the town of Raleigh, West Virginia, a suburb of Beckley showing some of the homes and a portion of the railroad tracks used to carry coal from the mines to industry throughout the country.
