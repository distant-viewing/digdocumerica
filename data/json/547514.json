{"path":"547514.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene focused on a weathered stone wall, likely serving as a fence line for a field. The wall is composed of dark, uneven stones likely gathered from the vicinity, building up into a somewhat irregular but sturdy barrier. To the left of the image, a collection of large rocks is piled, possibly as an extension of or break in the wall.\n\nThe foreground prominently features textured grasses and weeds, indicating a season that is not in the full flush of growthâ€”suggesting late autumn or early spring. These grasses, ranging in color from copper brown to dark red and interspersed with pale beige tufts possibly of flowering weeds, create a tangled bed around and near the stones.\n\nIn the background, a large open field stretches towards the horizon. The field appears to be a flat, sparsely vegetated meadow, with low-growing grasses that give it a somewhat barren look. Trees can be seen sparsely dotting the horizon under a grey, cloud-filled sky, suggesting a chilly or overcast day.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photo conveys a quiet, solitary rural landscape touched by the natural rugged beauty of the stone fence and untouched fields. It captures the essence of rustic outdoor simplicity, aligned with a sense of solitude and the tranquil passage of time marked by the natural aging of the stones and the seasonally dormant vegetation.","title":"Stone wall on farm in Narragansett","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["553809","558010","547518","547654","549156","557212","547522","547404","557194","554801","543122","543660","549142","545040","556961","552515"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["stone","weed","field","wall","grass","fence","tuft","dott","flowering","extension"]}
