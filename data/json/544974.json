{"path":"544974.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a focused scene of outdoor cooking. A man stands in the foreground meticulously preparing food. He is wearing a white long-sleeve shirt with a dark tie and glasses, exuding a neat, professional demeanor. His attention is directed toward pouring a liquid seasoning, likely a marinade or sauce, from a small package onto skewered pieces of fish positioned on a grill. The fish pieces are speared with wooden sticks and appear partially cooked.\n\nThe setting suggests an informal, natural environment indicated by visible trees and the glimpse of a calm waterfront in the background. Next to the man and part of the foreground, there are piles of chopped wood, suggesting preparation for either cooking or a campfire. The overall ambience combines elements of careful food preparation with the rustic, relaxed setting of an outdoor gathering near the water. The focus and framing suggest an intimate glimpse into a moment of culinary preparation, heavily emphasizing the central activity of cooking.","title":"Salmon bake, held by community of Browns Point to raise money for children's playground","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544986","544983","544979","549451","545017","546127","557801","554511","557700","550085","542726","557793","557934","551275","550081","553651"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["cooking","preparation","fish","food","campfire","glimpse","grill","piece","stick","ambience"]}
