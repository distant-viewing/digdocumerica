{"path":"554563.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures an old and seemingly abandoned railway station composed of shingle siding with a linear architectural structure. The building displays a series of closed doors and windows with white trim around them. On the left side of the station, it features a shaded porch area supported by wooden columns.\n\nLocated next to the railway station building is a small, blue structure explicitly named \"Shack by the Track.\" This smaller building, resembling a railway car, has white lettering on its side and appears to have been repurposed as a studio, as indicated by the sign \"Station Studio.\"\n\nAbove, multiple signs are visible. One sign projecting from the station reads \"Station Studio Crafts Gifts,\" suggesting the area might now be used for commercial purposes, such as selling crafts and gifts. Adjacent to this, a fading black sign reads \"Railway Express Agency,\" indicating the station's original use for railway express services.\n\nThe surroundings are grassy and unkempt, with no visible human activity, enhancing the sense of abandonment. The ensemble sits under a clear sky, and the overall mood suggests a quiet, desolate spot that juxtaposes its possible bustling past with its current serene and deserted state.","title":"Abandoned railroad station and freight room of the New York Central have been converted into art studio (the Station Studio) and art shop (the Shack by the Track) near Old Forge, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547656","547511","556124","556002","556040","554707","556129","554564","545233","556782","557944","543342","544820","552477","557090","556330"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["station","railway","sign","ensemble","shingle","past","craft","lettering","siding","column"]}
