{"path":"554764.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This is a photograph capturing an industrial landscape, likely a mining operation. The setting appears somewhat desolate and utilitarian with a heavy focus on the structures and machinery associated with mineral extraction and processing.\n\nIn the foreground, a series of darkened hills is partly vegetated with sparse grass and shrubs, indicative of a disturbed natural environment possibly due to the mining activities. The colors are predominantly muted, suggesting either overcast weather or a scene recorded with subdued lighting.\n\nCentral to the image are large mechanical devices, which include cranes, conveyor belts, and sorting machines, typical of a mining site. These are constructed primarily from metal and appear weathered, implying they have been in use for some time. The machinery is interspersed with piles of earth or coal and positioned on different levels of the terrain, using the natural topography to facilitate the movement of materials.\n\nOne prominent feature is the winding roads seen meandering through the site, indicating significant vehicle movement necessary for operational purposes. The roads also connect various parts of the facility, including small buildings that could serve as offices or storage areas.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph shows a blend of nature and industrial activity, with human alteration of the landscape evident in the infrastructure and lack of dense vegetation. The color palette consists of earth tones with greys and blacks dominating due to the industrial materials and the natural landscape possibly tainted by mining residues.","title":"This coal tipple is located where a farmhouse once stood.
