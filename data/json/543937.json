{"path":"543937.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a man involved in a sailing activity, specifically, he appears to be adjusting or maneuvering a small sailboat. The man is partially inside the hatch of the boat, with only his upper body visible. He is smiling and looking towards the camera, suggesting a candid and joyful moment.\n\nThe sailboat features bright and contrasting colors; a vibrant yellow and navy-blue triangular sail stretches across the frame, creating a visually striking element. The sails are attached to metal masts, with visible rigging adding to the intricacy of the scene.\n\nThe background is blurred, emphasizing the action in the foreground, yet hints of water can be perceived suggesting that the activity is taking place on a body of water, possibly a lake or calm sea. The lighting is natural, and hints of brighter daytime conditions can be gathered from the scene, complementing the outdoor and active nature of the setting.\n\nOverall, this image evokes a sense of enjoyment and leisure associated with sailing, highlighted by the man's cheerful expression and the vivid colors of the sailboat.","title":"Participant in the spring sunfish regatta of the Louisville sailing club","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543953","544029","548521","556192","549386","549405","549409","549392","549421","548513","544667","552345","549415","548062","549406","548526"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","sailing","sail","hatch","intricacy","navy","rigging","mast","maneuver","daytime"]}
