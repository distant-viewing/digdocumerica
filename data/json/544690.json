{"path":"544690.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a tranquil and somewhat surreal landscape dominated by a large body of water that reflects the sky above. At the center of the image stands a tall, triangular transmission tower. This tower is mirrored perfectly in the water below, enhancing its imposing structure against the flat horizon. The water itself is tinted with hues of pink and purple, likely due to the lighting conditions, possibly at dusk or dawn, which creates an ethereal and serene atmosphere.\n\nStretching into the distance from either side of the tower are multiple utility poles, establishing a continuous line that fades into the horizon. These poles are also reflected in the water, creating a double image effect that emphasizes the vast, flat expanse of the landscape. Overhead, multiple power lines can be seen attached to the tower and extending outward, following the line of the utility poles.\n\nThe sky is clear with a gentle gradation of blue, blending seamlessly into the waterâ€™s colors. This melding of sky and water colors adds to the overall calm and minimalist aesthetic of the scene. The horizon is flat and unbroken, suggesting that the location might be in a large open area, possibly a salt flat or a large shallow lake.\n\nOverall, the composition is centered and symmetrical, with the transmission tower acting as the focal point. The reflection of the tower and poles in the water doubles the visual impact, creating a sense of depth and stillness. The photograph invites contemplation due to its quiet and orderly presentation of the elements within it.","title":"Leslie Salt Ponds at sunset. \"Water stinks,\" writes the photographer about this scene.","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["546054","544695","549110","548208","544355","544675","543728","553830","543903","553028","553086","543058","545050","548035","544561","548136"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["tower","pole","transmission","water","utility","horizon","line","gradation","presentation","salt"]}
