{"path":"545789.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged and vast desert landscape, primarily illustrating sweeping views of layered sandstone rock formations and sparse vegetation. The foreground features textured, curving rock surfaces that suggest erosion patterns, colored in light shades of grey and beige. Small, hardy bushes and clumps of grass sporadically emerge from crevices in the rock, adding spots of green to the otherwise muted palette.\n\nIn the middle distance, a prominent sandstone pillar stands out due to its distinct, vertical structure and reddish-brown hue compared to the surrounding terrain. This formation resembles a chimney or tower, rising sharply from the relatively flat but undulating surface.\n\nThe background of the image extends the view of the desert, showing tiered rock formations that gradually recede into the distance. The horizon is marked by a skyline of rugged mesa tops and rocky outcroppings, sharply outlined against a clear sky with soft, ambient light suggesting either early morning or late evening.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a serene but stark natural environment typical of a desert region, emphasizing geological features and the resilience of flora that survives in such arid conditions.","title":"Looking north over crossbedded Navajo sandstone in Arches National Park toward the windows, where many of the natural arches are located.
