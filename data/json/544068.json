{"path":"544068.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting in a dry, arid landscape, characterized by its sparse vegetation. The foreground is covered with shrubs and patches of grass, typical of a semi-desert area. Dominating the middle of the frame is a large industrial complex. It includes multiple large structures such as silos, conveyors, buildings, and other machinery relevant to processing or manufacturing. There are large mounds of white material, likely mining by-products, piled next to the facilities, which could suggest that this is a mining or a mineral processing plant.\n\nThe background consists of low hills under a bright, clear sky, suggesting a hot and sunny climate. This is reinforced by the presence of dust and faint smoke emanating from several points within the industrial area, adding a sense of ongoing industrial activity.\n\nAlso notable are the transmission towers and power lines prominently featured in the image, emphasizing the significant energy demands of the plant. The overall composition and elements within the photograph depict a scene of industrial endeavor in a remote or less populated region, primarily driven by the extraction or processing of natural resources.","title":"Paul lime plant","placename":"Douglas (Ariz.)","location":"Douglas, Arizona","nn1":["552544","543642","546208","554764","543669","546055","545998","546122","549168","545992","552004","543733","542553","557403","548968","544048"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["processing","mining","demand","transmission","extraction","emanate","conveyor","endeavor","silo","plant"]}
