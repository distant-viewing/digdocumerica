{"path":"552195.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This image depicts an aerial view of a coastal area, potentially a port town with industrial and residential zones. The photograph captures a large body of blue water that dominates the foreground, dotted with multiple large logs or lumber rafts and noticeable white ripples possibly caused by recent movement of boats.\n\nThe middle section displays an industrial waterfront area characterized by multiple docks and warehouse-like structures. There are several ships moored at these docks, indicating active maritime operations. Connected to this, by an evident road, is a densely populated urban area sprawling into the hillside in the background. The town consists of closely packed buildings, suggesting a residential neighborhood. These buildings vary in color and size, integrated into a hilly landscape which implies a steep terrain.\n\nThe contrast between the industrial waterfront and the residential hillside highlights the multifunctional use of the coastal region. Natural resources like water and forests (hinted at by the rafts) seem vital to this locality. The use of water as a transport route is also apparent from the floating logs and active dock facilities.\n\nOverall, the area shown in the image is a dynamic blend of natural and human-built environments, illustrating active industrial, residential, and maritime activities.","title":"White foam on bay is from pulping waste.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551574","551607","552215","556945","549505","552133","551609","549528","552153","552132","550363","556947","543438","555688","557462","551606"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["raft","dock","hillside","waterfront","log","town","locality","lumber","use","port"]}
