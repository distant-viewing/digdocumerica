{"path":"556495.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts a young woman standing in the center of a dirt road with a lively expression and a joyful smile. She is dressed in an elegant, light blue dress that reaches down to her feet. The dress features a subtle floral pattern, and it appears to be sleeveless, with a bow accent on her left side at the waist. \n\nThe setting is a rural scene, likely in a small town or village. The road is rugged, and uneven with visible stones and patches of grass. Alongside the road, we see sporadic vegetation, small structures, and a fence made of wire and wooden posts. Various cars are parked along the sides of the road, and the houses are modest, single-story buildings, possibly made from bricks and featuring vines or bushes growing on their exteriors.\n\nIn the background, the landscape stretches up into a wooded hill, signaling a close proximity to natural, wooded areas. The sky is clear and suggests it might be late morning or noon given the amount of sunlight and the shadows cast on the road. Overhead, utility poles with wires are visible, aligning with the rustic and functional nature of the community infrastructure seen in the photograph. This image captures a moment of personal significance, perhaps a celebration or a special event, indicated by the woman's formal attire contrasted with the casual, everyday environment around her.","title":"Dora darlene hancock, daughter of martha crider, living in fireco, West Virginia, near Beckley.
