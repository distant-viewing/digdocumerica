{"path":"545228.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a family picnic scene in a lush forest setting. The image, taken from an elevated angle overlooking the scene, features a group gathered around a picnic table in a clearing surrounded by tall pine trees that fade softly into the background.\n\nAt the center, an open grassy area hosts a picnic table covered with a red and white checkered cloth, loaded with various picnic essentials, such as a portable stove, pots, dishes, and food containers. There's a visible presence of numerous personal items and recreational gear indicating an organized and leisurely outing.\n\nThere are five individuals in the scene. Two women appear to be preparing or organizing the meal at the table. A young girl in a yellow dress is sitting at one end of the table, seemingly engaged in conversation or waiting for food. The focal point of the scene is a young child standing in the foreground, looking directly up as if interacting with the person taking the photo or observing something in the trees. This child is wearing a light grey sweatshirt and darker grey pants. On the left, another child wearing a yellow shirt is visible, seemingly in motion, playing with a green ball.\n\nThe combination of natural sunlight and the shadows cast by the pine trees give the scene a peaceful, serene ambiance, typical of a pleasant day outdoors. The use of natural light and forest as a backdrop creates a calm and tranquil setting for this family gathering.","title":"Campground at oswald west.
