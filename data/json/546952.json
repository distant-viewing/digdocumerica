{"path":"546952.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph features an older model, boxy truck parked in a shaded, grassy area. The side of the truck displays large, bold text that reads \"EVANGELIST T.J. PHILIP - REVIVAL CRUSADE\" along with other phrases such as \"DELIVERANCE!\", \"THE BLIND SEE\", \"DEAF HEAR\", \"HEALING\", \"SALVATION\", \"GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT IN ACTION!\", and \"SIGNS & WONDERS!\". The truck has a striking vintage design, indicative of the mid-20th century, complete with solid tires and a rugged chassis.\n\nOn the truck, there are addresses listed, mentioning places like Miami (Kendall Branch), Pasadena California, and phone numbers provided for contact. This seems to suggest that the truck is used for traveling evangelism, possibly moving between these locations for religious revivals and events.\n\nThe background of the image reveals a tranquil setting under a large tree draped with Spanish moss, typical of a Southern Gothic atmosphere. Just beyond the tree, one can see a glimpse of a cemetery, lending an eerie yet serene touch to the setting. The graveyard has several traditional upright headstones, and the overall scene is quiet and undisturbed, suggesting the photo was taken in a secluded or private area. The combination of the revivalist truck and the cemetery in the background offers a strong visual contrast between themes of life and renewal versus eternity and rest.","title":"St. Helena's Island","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["544370","555513","544720","552673","552087","544061","544767","549883","542853","556986","545295","548275","555817","556429","552997","548980"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["truck","cemetery","renewal","chassis","headstone","address","wonder","phrase","contact","phone"]}
