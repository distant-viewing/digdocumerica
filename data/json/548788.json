{"path":"548788.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a collection of round objects, possibly buoys, laid out on a wooden deck. Each buoy is painted white with red, swirling designs and symbols that appear somewhat tribal or abstract in nature, adding a visually interesting motif to their surfaces. The buoys are clustered together, dominating the foreground of the image, covering the wooden slats of the deck beneath them.\n\nIn the background, the focus is less sharp, creating a blurred effect that contrasts with the clarity of the buoys in the foreground. Visible in the distance are a stop sign and possibly a rural roadway, hinting that this location might be near a coastal or roadside area. The setting is bright and sunlit, suggesting an outdoor environment under clear skies. The overall composition leverages depth of field to emphasize the detailed designs on the buoys while allowing the background to fade into a soft blur, further concentrating attention on the primary subjects of the image.","title":"Numbered floats of the lobster fishermen of Conch Key during the off-season, thousands of these are newly painted and stored all over the little island.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["547937","548766","550306","550305","548740","548501","550058","547169","552301","547548","542911","548688","548767","546789","548078","547561"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["buoy","deck","slat","motif","stop","blur","symbol","design","clarity","roadway"]}
