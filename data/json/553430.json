{"path":"553430.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph captures two young boys swimming in what appears to be a river or a muddy body of water. The older boy, on the left side of the image, is slightly more submerged, with water covering his shoulders and his wet, dark hair slicked back. His right leg is bent upward with his foot peeking out of the water in a playful pose. He is smiling broadly, looking directly at the camera with an expression full of energy and enjoyment.\n\nThe younger boy, positioned on the right, appears to be somewhat deeper in the water, with the surface reaching up to his neck. His face is serious or possibly wary, and his gaze is also directed at the camera. His dark, wet hair is slicked to the side and his body is submerged, showing only his head and shoulders above the water.\n\nThe water around them is murky and ripples gently, indicating their movements. The background of the scene is simple and blurred, emphasizing the focus on the boys. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be taken during a sunny day, given the brightness and reflections on the water's surface.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a lively, joyful, and candid moment of childhood spent playing in the water, highlighting the natural, unguarded expressions and the playful atmosphere.","title":"Swimming hole on the squannacook river near groton.
