{"path":"554492.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a bright, lively scene at a golf course where three individuals are engaged in the sport. The foreground shows two golf bags placed on trolleys; one gold and one red, both with clubs inside. A person on the left side, wearing a yellow shirt and dark pants, stands and watches to the side, holding what appears to be a golf club or an object. Another individual in a black outfit, including a beret and black shoes, is also positioned facing away from the camera, apparently just having taken a swing as indicated by their posture which suggests the follow-through of a golf swing. The third person is actively engaged in a golf swing, dressed in blue jeans and a dark long-sleeve shirt, and is most fully captured mid-swing with a club raised backward over their head.\n\nThe background showcases a broad, open grassy landscape under a sky with soft clouds, highlighting the rolling green hills typical of a golf course. The horizon is marked by trees and a large rounded hill. This setting provides a serene atmosphere typical of golf courses, emphasizing spaciousness and the natural beauty of the outdoor environment. The lighting suggests it might be a bright sunny day, enhancing the colors of the scene.","title":"Golfing at the Cedar River Course near Indian Lake, New York in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554149","546959","554167","552608","543633","549069","557512","554148","546513","545249","558098","548821","547286","548580","553980","543262"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["golf","swing","club","course","spaciousness","gold","hill","person","shoe","sport"]}
