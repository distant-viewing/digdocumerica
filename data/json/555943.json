{"path":"555943.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene that appears to be taken during or just after a rain, as the ground is wet. In the foreground, three young girls stand close together, posing for the camera. They are dressed in casual, somewhat worn clothing; one girl wears a striped shirt, another in a yellow dress with polka dots, and the third in a white and pastel shirt. All three are smiling or smirking and seem to be enjoying the attention from the camera.\n\nBehind the girls, there's an old, damaged car parked on the street. The car, a sedan, shows significant aging and wear; it has visible rust and missing parts on its body, particularly at the front where the grille should be. The car's hood is partly corroded, adding to the sense of decay.\n\nThe background shows a somewhat desolate urban setting with sparse vegetation and buildings that also appear aged and somewhat rundown. The street is empty except for these elements and another distant figure barely visible in the background, further enhancing the quiet, wet atmosphere that the photograph captures.","title":"Three young girls on Bond Street in Brooklyn, New York City the inner city today is an absolute contradiction to the mainstream America of gas stations, expressways, shopping centers and tract homes. It is populated by blacks, Latins and the white poor some of the best 19th century architecture still survives there. But most of all, the inner city environment means human beings.","placename":"Brooklyn (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Brooklyn, New York","nn1":["555895","549273","551001","552756","551002","552965","545379","545331","553507","547185","545326","553315","551005","555941","553488","545321"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["girl","street","car","grille","miss","hood","camera","aging","rain","sedan"]}
