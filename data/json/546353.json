{"path":"546353.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a man engaged in scientific or research activities within an indoor laboratory setting. He is seated on a black stool, focusing intently on glass jars labeled with contents like \"Shrimp\" and \"Fish.\" The jars are systematically arranged on dark metal shelving units which are stocked with additional lab materials. The man wears a casual sleeveless white tank top and shorts, suggesting a relaxed or informal work environment. He has short dark hair and is wearing sneakers.\n\nTo his right, there appears to be a larger setup involving tanks or aquaria integrated with various hoses and mechanisms, potentially for maintaining live aquatic specimens. Above these tanks, there is a mounted map and a clip lighting fixture pointing downwards, indicating that precise work or examinations are conducted in this area. The room is utilitarian with visible ductwork and simple wood paneling on the walls.\n\nThe overall setting and equipment suggest that the activities being performed are related to marine biology or a similar field, focusing possibly on the study of aquatic life forms which are housed in the laboratory for observation or experimentation.","title":"Mobile lab of the Southeast Water Laboratory Athens, GA.
