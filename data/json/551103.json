{"path":"551103.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene of a youth baseball game unfolding in an unusual industrial setting. In the foreground, a young player is crouched in a catcher's stance, wearing a uniform with \"Grove\" and the number \"8\" on the back, paired with matching green and white striped socks and a baseball mitt. The colors of his uniform stand out against the dusty, reddish-brown dirt of the field.\n\nIn the background, other young players and spectators are clustered around, watching the game. Notably, some of the crowd includes people who seem to be workers or attendees dressed in regular casual attire instead of sports gear.\n\nThe most striking aspect of this image is the juxtaposition of the baseball game with a large industrial complex directly behind the field. The industrial setting features tall structures, possibly a factory or power plant, with visible pipes and large metallic towers. The facility appears to have a series of smaller buildings and storage units attached. Lush green hills serve as a backdrop to the industrial architecture, emphasizing a contrast between the natural environment and man-made structures.\n\nThe scene is bathed in the warm glow of what could be late afternoon sunlight, adding a serene but somewhat surreal quality to the setting where the enthusiasm and innocence of a children's game meet the gritty industrial landscape.","title":"Evening game at glasgow little league field.
