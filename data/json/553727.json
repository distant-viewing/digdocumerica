{"path":"553727.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling highway scene, likely taken during a time of peak traffic. The highway is filled with a dense lineup of cars, extending into the distance along curving lanes. The majority of the vehicles are conventional passenger cars of various colors, and there are also some trucks visible in the mix, indicating the road's use for both commuter and commercial transport.\n\nThe highway is shown with multiple lanes in each direction, separated by a central barricade. On the left side of the photo, cars in the nearest lanes toward the viewer are almost at a standstill, suggesting a traffic jam, while on the right side, vehicles appear to be moving, although slowly. The setting sun casts long shadows and gives a warm tone to the scene, suggesting that this photo was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon.\n\nIn the periphery, there are green grassy areas and sporadic trees, indicating suburban or semi-urban surroundings. Electric poles and some construction signs are also evident, suggesting ongoing road work or infrastructure maintenance, which could be contributing to the traffic slowdown. The light and shadows indicate that the photo was taken from an elevated position, possibly a bridge or another highway crossing, giving an expansive view of the traffic situation below.","title":"Morning rush hour traffic on h-1 freeway approaching Honolulu from the west.
