{"path":"546154.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, rustic landscape at what appears to be either dawn or dusk, as suggested by the low lighting. The scene is dominated by a large field of tall grass, which glistens under the sunlight, creating a shimmering effect. The grass is densely packed and sways gently, suggesting a light breeze.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a fence made of wooden posts and wire, stretching horizontally across the image and partially framing the field. The fence is old and weathered, adding a touch of ruggedness to the scene.\n\nThe background features a line of trees and a softly rolling hill. The trees form a dark silhouette against the sky, hinting at a dense, lush area behind the open field. The sky itself, visible above the landscape, is clear with no visible clouds, contributing to the strong backlighting effect which silhouettes the trees and fence posts.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is peaceful and contemplative, with a strong sense of isolation and untouched natural beauty. The composition, with its focus on the interplay of light and shadow, highlights the textures of the grass and the rustic charm of the fence, evoking a timeless, pastoral aesthetic.","title":"Sunset","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["549146","545018","557104","545069","545040","549142","549156","556990","552312","557559","549249","542895","543414","549233","557191","555567"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["fence","post","field","grass","sway","effect","backlighting","silhouette","ruggedness","breeze"]}
