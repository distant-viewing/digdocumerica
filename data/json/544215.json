{"path":"544215.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"In this photograph, a young child sits on the lap of an adult who appears to be a woman. They are settled into a lush, serene environment surrounded by thick green foliage and trees. The setting suggests a natural, outdoor location, possibly a forest or a dense garden. \n\nThe child, who appears to be a toddler, is comfortably drinking from a baby bottle while resting on a colorful blanket with pink flowers, which is spread over the ground. The woman is gently holding the child, demonstrating a caring and attentive posture. Both are dressed casually, with the child wearing a striped shirt and the woman wearing a dark short-sleeved top.\n\nLight filtering through the leaves creates a tranquil and somewhat dim lighting in the scene, highlighting the intimacy and peacefulness of the moment between the child and the woman. The overall ambiance of the image conveys a sense of quietude and closeness to nature.","title":"By the lakeshore","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["554921","553496","556144","553543","556294","553219","543863","543860","558186","553523","543854","551473","550090","553377","553533","547072"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["child","woman","baby","toddler","closeness","intimacy","quietude","filtering","lap","blanket"]}
