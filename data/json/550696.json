{"path":"550696.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a scene of a construction or development area. In the foreground, there is a wooden sign which reads \"APPALACHIAN TRAIL\" at the top and presents the information that the trail stretches from \"MAINE TO GEORGIA\" on the arrows. This sign is slightly worn and supported by posts that look makeshift or temporarily erected.\n\nIn the background, the picture captures a variety of construction machinery and equipment in use. There is a large yellow excavator in the center and other unidentifiable machinery scattered across a cleared area, indicating some heavy construction or land clearing activity is in progress. Towards the mid-ground, a white house with a green roof is visible, suggesting that this site is close to a residential area.\n\nThe area around the construction site appears to be a mixture of cleared land with exposed earth, debris, and scattered foliage. There's a road visible adjacent to the scene, partially guarded by a fence, where a car is driving by. Beyond the immediate site, the landscape includes lush green trees backed by rolling hills, giving a hint of a rural or semi-rural setting. The sky is clear and deep blue, suggesting a sunny day which adds a vivid contrast to the overall composition of the image.","title":"Sign near the Maine-New Hampshire border at \"Shelburne Birches\" on the Androscoggin River points the way to Georgia via the Appalachian Trail.
