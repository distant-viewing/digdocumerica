{"path":"554502.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a group of three young men hiking through a birch tree forest. The scene is rich with natural elements and appears to be taken during the day given the light filtering through the trees. The ground is wet, indicating recent rain or a wetland area, and the hikers are navigating over what looks like a small stream or muddy path using flattened logs and rocks.\n\nOn the left side, the first hiker is bearded, wearing glasses, a white long sleeve shirt under a dark vest, blue jeans, and hiking boots. He is carrying a large backpack with red highlights and is looking down at a map or guide, navigating or checking the trail route.\n\nIn the middle, the second hiker is in action, seemingly mid-stride as he steps over the log. He has a dynamic pose with one arm reaching for balance. He's dressed in a white t-shirt under a dark vest, blue jeans, and is also wearing boots. His facial expression concentrates on his footing.\n\nThe third hiker on the right stands slightly raised on a rounded rock, with a relaxed posture. He sports a full beard, wears a dark green jacket over a light green shirt, blue jeans, and carries a green backpack. His expression is casual and observant as he looks toward the first hiker, perhaps following the navigation.\n\nThe surrounding forest is lush and vibrant with verdant undergrowth and mature birch trees marked by their distinctive white bark. The natural light creates a mixture of shadows and highlights in the forest, creating a peaceful yet adventurous atmosphere. Overall, the image conveys a sense of companionship and adventure among the group as they navigate the forested trail.","title":"Backpackers cross a bridge near the falls of MacIntyre Brook on the trail up Algonquin Mountain in the Adirondack Forest Preserve, second highest point in New York State.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554705","554558","554663","554662","545512","554501","545493","543331","543388","545088","554508","544305","557005","554510","554672","554503"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["hiker","birch","backpack","jean","vest","highlight","boot","trail","log","forest"]}
