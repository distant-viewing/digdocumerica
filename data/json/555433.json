{"path":"555433.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a person riding a bicycle along a paved pathway. The cyclist, who appears to be a young adult, is dressed warmly in dark clothing, including a heavy coat and gloves, and is wearing a white helmet. The bicycle is equipped with multiple bags, likely carrying personal items or goods, indicating that this could be a commuting or utility ride.\n\nThe setting is overcast with a leaden sky that suggests cold or inclement weather. The background includes urban details like a lamppost on the left side of the image and a subdued cityscape with buildings that appear industrial or low-rise residential. There is also visible smoke or steam, adding to the sense of a chilly atmosphere.\n\nThe composition of the image uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the cyclist while making the background blurred but still discernible. The overall tone and color palette are moody and cool, dominated by grays and subdued hues, enhancing the sense of an overcast, possibly winter day. The perspective is taken from a level angle with the cyclist approaching directly towards the camera, emphasizing the solitude and forward movement of the subject.","title":"Motorcycles came out of summer vacation retirement during the fuel crisis in the pacific northwest during the fall of 1973.
