{"path":"549047.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image features a quirky and visually interesting scene set against an outdoor wall. The main subject is a mural of a large, green saguaro cactus painted onto the white brick wall. The saguaro is detailed, showing the iconic ridged texture typical of this type of cactus, complete with several arms extending upwards.\n\nIntriguingly, a real rectangular air conditioning unit is installed on the wall, positioned so it appears as though it is mounted on the trunk of the painted cactus. This creates a playful and surreal blending of real and artistic elements.\n\nThe white painted wall serves as a stark, clean background that highlights the rich green color and distinct silhouette of the painted cactus. Additionally, there is a strong shadow cast onto the wall, extending diagonally across the mural. This shadow adds depth to the scene and further emphasizes the three-dimensional aspect of the air conditioning unit juxtaposed against the two-dimensional painting.\n\nThe surrounding details are minimal, allowing the viewer to focus primarily on the central visual joke conveyed through the merging of the mundane (an air conditioning unit) with the whimsical (a painted cactus). This setup provides a moment of urban whimsy, likely designed to bring a smile or provoke thought in passersby about the ordinary transformed into something extraordinary through artistic vision.","title":"Desert cactus plant painted on house wall.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["545323","552498","556230","556231","546457","552478","545810","544750","555367","555286","555911","555366","555340","552530","551489","556628"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["cactus","conditioning","mural","unit","wall","paint","air","blending","transform","passersby"]}
