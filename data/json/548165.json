{"path":"548165.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a rustic, wooden building situated in the foreground on the left, characterized by a rugged exterior with weather-beaten planks and a simple peaked roof topped with a white cross, suggesting it may serve a religious purpose, like a small chapel. The building's door is ajar, and it features an old-style wooden latch. There are rocks and sparse vegetation around the structure, indicating a rough, dry landscape.\n\nIn the background, spanning horizontally across the image, is a large dam with multiple arches, holding back a body of water. The dam's substantial structure contrasts with the simplicity of the wooden chapel, underscoring a blend of natural setting and human engineering. The hills in the far background have gentle slopes and appear barren or sparsely vegetated, enhancing the scene's remote and rugged feel. The sky is clear and vividly blue, suggesting a sunny, serene day. The lighting is bright, casting clear shadows and emphasizing the textures of the wooden building and the rocky ground.","title":"Last remnant of an Indian fishing village on the Washington state side of the Columbia River.
