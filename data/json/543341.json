{"path":"543341.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph presents a vivid and detailed view of a ghost town, featuring an array of abandoned wooden buildings in varying states of decay. The scene captures a central cluster of houses, likely from a historical settlement, situated in a grassy valley surrounded by gently sloping hills.\n\nThe foreground shows a mixture of grass and sparse vegetation, with a few scattered remnants such as wooden barrels and fragments suggesting past activities. The middle ground is dominated by the multiple structures including wooden houses and sheds. The houses differ in size and design, some featuring front porches, pitched roofs, and weathered, unpainted wood, giving off an aura of a deserted, once-inhabited town. There are no visible signs of current human activity which enhances the sense of abandonment.\n\nIn the background, the landscape gradually ascends into barren, hilly terrain, hinting at the isolation and seclusion of this abandoned place. The colors in the photograph are rich and saturated, with the natural earth tones of the buildings and landscape contrasting against the vivid blue sky, highlighting the desolation and stillness of the environment. \n\nOverall, this image provides a powerful glimpse into a forgotten fragment of history, evoking a sense of curiosity and nostalgia about the life and stories that once filled this now-silent town.","title":"Southern California -- Carmel Highlands","placename":"Carmel (Calif.)","location":"Carmel, California","nn1":["543351","543367","543349","543342","543354","545233","543356","543353","554788","543344","556330","553551","551330","556999","551111","556313"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["town","fragment","house","aura","nostalgia","seclusion","barrel","settlement","shed","desolation"]}
