{"path":"545883.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a large-scale mining operation. The focus of the image is on a massive, red crane situated near the center, operating on dark, exposed earth. The crane is large with a visible cab and a long boom extended towards the dug-up soil, indicative of ongoing excavation activities. \n\nThe landscape around the crane is carved up with deep trenches and piles of displaced earth, creating a stark contrast with the untouched green areas in the distance. The expansive site is marked by tracks and paths carved out by the movement of machinery, which is evident even from this high viewpoint.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate area of industrial activity, there is a more verdant landscape with patches of trees, grasslands, and a river visibly meandering through the terrain. Some roads intersect through these greener areas, suggesting a blend of untouched nature with industrial intrusion.\n\nThe horizon is hazy, possibly due to dust, suggesting air contamination from the active digging and movement at the site. The lighting in the image hints that it might be either early morning or later in the afternoon, given the softness and glow diffusing across the scene.","title":"Big brown, a coal mining operation","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["545887","545831","554770","545888","544134","545846","555593","554545","554826","544165","555606","549174","549171","552416","554812","554765"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["crane","carve","digging","earth","trench","contamination","site","intrusion","cab","softness"]}
