{"path":"543128.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic mountain landscape under what appears to be either a sunset or sunrise, casting deep red and orange hues across the scene. The frame is dominated by rugged mountain peaks, with the central and most prominent peak exhibiting sharp, cliff-like edges and partially covered in snow. There is minimal vegetation visible, suggesting a high altitude or a cold environment.\n\nA significant feature of this photograph is the rainbow that emerges at an angle on the left, adding a spectrum of colors against the darker sky background. The light play and shadowing enhance the depth and texture of the mountainâ€™s surface.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by this image is one of serene isolation and the raw beauty of nature, emphasized by the dramatic lighting and the mesmerizing appearance of the rainbow amidst the rugged terrain.","title":"Rainbow above Mono Lake.
