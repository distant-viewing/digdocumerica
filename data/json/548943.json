{"path":"548943.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a landscape intertwining natural formations and human developments. Dominating the scenery is a meandering river flowing from the upper left corner of the image to the middle right side, cutting through a largely barren or snowy landscape. Beside the river, a variety of geometric, rectangular agricultural fields in different colors, ranging from deep reds to beige, create a patchwork effect. Some areas are covered with snow, indicating a cold weather season.\n\nNear the bottom of the image, adjacent to a bend in the river, there is an industrial complex with structures organized in a grid-like pattern. The presence of roads and constructed areas can be seen interfacing with untouched natural land, showing a juxtaposition of urban development and wilderness.\n\nThe photo is tinged with a retro, somewhat greenish overlay, typical of older film photography, giving it a dated look that suggests the photo was taken several decades ago. The atmosphere appears a bit hazy, possibly due to atmospheric conditions or the photographic techniques used at the time. All these elements together provide a depiction of how human activities are intertwined with natural geographical features from an aerial perspective.","title":"The Colorado river feeds crops and vegetation (dark areas) town of needles in foreground","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548931","547227","555685","550392","547995","550393","547724","549498","545144","549081","555684","550534","552594","550539","543742","550623"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","development","intertwin","interface","fields","patchwork","retro","tinge","technique","near"]}
