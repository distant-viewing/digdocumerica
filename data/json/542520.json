{"path":"542520.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a striking high-altitude landscape, possibly of a mountain range. The foreground and midground are dominated by rugged, snow-covered terrain with patches of rock and sparse vegetation visible. The composition reveals a deep valley that is mostly enveloped in snow, suggesting this could be taken during late spring or early summer when the snow is melting but hasn't completely disappeared.\n\nThe mountains slope steeply, and their rocky surfaces are interspersed with snow, indicating the harsh climatic conditions of the area. The perspective might be from a high vantage point, looking down into the valley which extends toward the horizon.\n\nThe sky occupies the upper third of the image and features a dramatic and cloud-filled scene, suggesting unstable or changing weather typical of high mountain environments. The clouds are thick and fluffy, indicating potential atmospheric turbulence or approaching storm systems. The overall lighting in the photo is natural, with the sunlight possibly diffused through the clouds, casting dynamic shadows and highlights across the mountainous terrain.\n\nThis scene is devoid of human presence or any man-made structures, emphasizing the natural and untamed essence of the landscape. The vista conveys a sense of isolation and the grand scale of nature's geography in high mountain regions, offering a visual testimony to the rugged and pristine environments found at such altitudes.","title":"Central California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["550502","542519","550419","550515","550514","550501","550422","550423","550408","550415","550505","543831","550421","550500","550516","550504"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["snow","mountain","altitude","valley","melte","turbulence","geography","vista","third","atmospheric"]}
