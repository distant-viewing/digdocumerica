{"path":"555224.jpg","date":"July 1971","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a scene centered around a polluted body of water, likely part of an industrial area given the presence of wooden logs and dark oily water, suggesting proximity to a logging or maritime site. Central to the image is a discarded cardboard box labeled \"CANNED SALMON\" containing some debris, floating in the contaminated water. The box is surrounded by clusters of refuse, including small wood chips and possibly bits of plastic or other human-made materials, highlighting environmental pollution.\n\nThe backdrop features rough wooden pillars that look tarred or soaked in oil, emphasizing the industrial nature of the area. Metal chains hang from some of these pillars, possibly used for mooring or other functional purposes in this setting. The surface of some logs can be seen resting in the water, adding to the cluttered and neglected impression of the scene.\n\nNo visible wildlife or natural elements, other than wood, provide any relief from the man-made detritus and contamination, creating a stark commentary on environmental neglect and the impact of industrial activities on natural waterways. The image evokes a sense of abandonment and misuse, possibly serving as a subtle call to attention about the consequences of environmental degradation.","title":"Pollution in Bellingham, Washington, harbor from a pulp mill","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547907","550812","547626","547513","552127","550352","546854","544810","544647","546898","550800","552158","547525","547897","551440","551560"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["pillar","box","log","consequence","detritus","mooring","relief","wood","contamination","chip"]}
