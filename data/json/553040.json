{"path":"553040.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photo depicts a suburban street scene focused around a small utility vehicle, which appears to be specialized for trash collection or street cleaning. The vehicle is white, compact, and features a front cab where a man is visible through the window, facing towards the camera. The vehicle is equipped with rear-facing seats where a young boy is sitting, facing away and partially obscured.\n\nIn the immediate foreground to the left of the vehicle are two large green trash bins marked \"93\" and \"96\" respectively, suggesting they are designated for specific residents or locations. Between and slightly in front of these bins is a cardboard box filled with what looks like wood shavings.\n\nThe background shows a residential area with modest single-story homes, large trees, and well-kept front yards. The sky is bright and clear, indicating a sunny day.\n\nThe presence of both the man and the boy suggests a community or domestic activity, possibly the man is demonstrating the vehicle's function to the boy or they are engaged in a community clean-up effort. The overall setting gives the impression of a quiet, tidy suburban environment, likely focused on maintaining cleanliness and order.","title":"New trash pick-up methods.
