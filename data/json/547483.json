{"path":"547483.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene coastal scene at dusk or dawn. The primary focus is on the tranquil interaction between the sea and shoreline. A sun, appearing as a faint orange orb, is partially visible in the sky toward the upper left of the frame and casts a gentle light over the scene.\n\nThe foreground of the image includes a sandy beach, onto which gentle waves are lapping. Scattered across the sand are numerous dark rocks and boulders, which appear slick, possibly due to moisture from the sea.\n\nToward the right of the photograph, large rocks or boulders extend from the sand into the sea, forming a rugged and textured coastline. These rocks, layered and angular, provide a sharp contrast to the relatively smooth surface of the water.\n\nThe water itself occupies the mid and background, extending to the horizon where it meets a subtly lighter sky. The overall lighting is dim, suggesting that the photo was taken during the low light conditions of early morning or late evening, which adds a moody and somewhat mysterious atmosphere to the scene. There are no people or man-made objects visible, emphasizing the natural and untouched environment. The color palette is muted, dominated by blues, grays, and the orange glow of the sun.","title":"Rhode Island Sound","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["543091","553989","547492","544985","543025","542890","547638","543060","553852","542808","543068","547496","557508","557509","543081","543064"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["boulder","sea","rock","orange","sand","orb","sun","moisture","coastline","dawn"]}
