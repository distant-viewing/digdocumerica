{"path":"546948.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts two men engaging in a discussion on a wooden deck covered with miscellaneous items. The setting appears to be an outdoor or semi-outdoor area, possibly a porch, shaded by a white structure overhead.\n\nOne man is dressed in a yellow and blue checked shirt, dark pants, and a dark colored hat with a pipe in his mouth. His posture is slightly bent forward as he looks at the object the other man is holding. The second man, who is shirtless and wearing red trunks, is showing something on his wrist to the first man, both of them seeming involved in their discussion.\n\nThe wooden floor of the deck is weathered and stained, scattered with a few objects including a dirty white container with a lid, a green glass bottle, a crushed aluminum can, and a small pack of cigarettes. The general atmosphere of the scene hints at a casual, perhaps leisurely moment between the two individuals, in an environment associated with outdoor work or relaxation.","title":"There is a shrimp fishing industry on lady's island.
