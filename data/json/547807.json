{"path":"547807.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene and expansive river scene. The river, characterized by calm waters that reflect a subtle blue from the sky, runs horizontally across the frame, dividing the composition into a foreground of natural rough grasses and an opposite tree-lined bank. The river bank to the left is densely populated with lush green trees and some submerged vegetation, suggesting a high water level, possibly due to recent rains.\n\nIn the distance, the natural ambiance contrasts sharply with a vivid industrial setting. A factory or plant with multiple structures is seen, marked by its white and gray buildings. Prominent from this facility are plumes of white smoke or steam emanating from several large stacks, dispersing into the clear sky above. The presence of industrial activity in the scene introduces a dialogue about nature versus human impact.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of calmness in nature juxtaposed with human industrial activity, possibly pointing to themes of environmental impact and the coexistence of natural and developed spaces. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting gentle illumination over the landscape.","title":"Eastman kodak plant in Longview","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["552040","557239","557234","551519","548076","553393","550710","557376","543813","548097","552194","557377","546705","545100","550860","550995"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["bank","dialogue","river","emanat","impact","introduce","disperse","calmness","illumination","coexistence"]}
