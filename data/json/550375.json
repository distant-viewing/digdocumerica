{"path":"550375.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This image features a mesmerizing, abstract swirl of colors and patterns. Dominated by shades of black, white, and gray, it closely resembles a marble or ink-in-water effect. The center of the image has a large, eye-like pattern, with concentric swirls and dynamic, fluid contours that radiate outward. Dark areas contrast sharply with white and lighter gray streaks, creating an intriguing visual texture that simulates movement and depth.\n\nThere are no identifiable objects, activities, or people within the image; its composition is purely aesthetic and pattern-focused. The background merges seamlessly with the featured patterns, emphasizing the abstract and artistic quality of the photograph. The use of color and flow in this image invokes a natural, organic feel, possibly resembling natural geological formations or aerial views of storm patterns in a highly stylized form.","title":"Foam, a sign of pollution, floats on the st.
