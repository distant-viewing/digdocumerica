{"path":"555958.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures the interior of a vintage train lounge or observation car. The style suggests it may be from the mid-20th century, characterized by vibrant and bold colors. The seating is upholstered in shades of pink and red vinyl, providing a colorful contrast against the deep purple or burgundy walls. The chairs are paired with circular, black-topped tables, some of which are fitted with ashtrays, emphasizing the era's social norms.\n\nTowards the back, a man is seen engaged in work or possibly reading, leaning over a formica tabletop that reflects light, indicating either a bright interior light or natural light streaming from adjacent windows. This section seems to be a small workspace or counter area, also resonating with the interior décor through the use of wood paneling and similar color schemes.\n\nThe layout and design elements such as chromed edges and a general streamlined aesthetic hint at a design philosophy from the mid-20th-century modernism, focusing on both function and stylish appeal. The overall atmosphere evokes a sense of retro travel luxury, suggesting comfort and social interaction typical of train travel from the past. The presence of large windows suggests the car is designed to offer expansive views, complementing the leisurely pace of train travel with visual enjoyment of changing landscapes.","title":"Interior of one of the Amtrak passenger trains which has been refurnished at a plant in Mira Loma, California, near Riverside. It is one of several places in the United States where equipment is overhauled mechanically and repainted. What can be reconditioned is reused, but much of the interiors are replaced with more modern materials.","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["556781","556833","556061","555974","555997","556094","555999","556080","556088","556671","556052","555994","555982","556656","555977","556834"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["travel","train","streaming","décor","luxury","lounge","paneling","pace","retro","century"]}
