{"path":"558361.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Haque, Abul","caption":"This photograph depicts a baker in a bakery setting. The baker, a middle-aged man with a stocky build and light skin, is wearing a white baker's uniform consisting of a short-sleeved shirt and pants, which are slightly dusted with flour. He also wears a traditional white paper hat on his head. He is smiling and looking directly at the camera, exuding a sense of pride and contentment.\n\nIn his hands, he is holding two large, freshly baked loaves of bread, characterized by a golden-brown crust. The loaves are rectangular and appear to be quite soft and fluffy; each is quite sizable, extending the length of his forearm.\n\nIn the background, there is a metal rack filled with similar loaves of bread, some wrapped in plastic bags stacked neatly on the shelves. Behind the baker, a partial view of an industrial baking oven can be observed, suggesting the setting is indeed a bakery's kitchen. The lighting in the space gives a warm glow, emphasizing the freshness and warm appeal of the baked goods. The overall ambiance reflects a busy, productive environment likely filled with the aromatic scents of freshly baked bread.","title":"Homemade bread and sweet rolls are made daily by jim tillman of tillman's bakery.
