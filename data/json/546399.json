{"path":"546399.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a detailed view of a residential area characterized by an extensive, grid-like pattern of streets and houses. At the forefront, the neighborhood consists primarily of closely packed single-story homes, likely suburban in nature. The roofs of these houses appear to be uniformly designed, predominantly in shades of gray and blue, suggesting a sort of collective housing development or planned community.\n\nThe streets are neatly arranged in a very structured manner, with parallel roads interconnected by perpendicular ones, forming a labyrinth of orderly blocks. Each house seems to be accompanied by small patches of greenery, suggesting backyard gardens or small yards, and there are sparse trees lining the streets.\n\nThe surrounding area beyond the dense residential layout transitions into less densely populated zones with more green spaces, indicating the outskirts of the suburban development. In the distance, the terrain becomes hilly and more rural, with visible patches of undisturbed land and fewer structures, leading up to a mountain range that forms a dramatic backdrop to this community.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a well-organized, densely populated suburban area, contrasting with the natural, less developed landscape that surrounds it. The photo also suggests a viewpoint of exploration or surveying, offering a comprehensive glimpse into the layout and planning of residential developments within a larger geographical context.","title":"Bayoman housing development","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"San Juan, Puero Rico","nn1":["545914","549071","556975","553940","553939","553700","553937","558112","548825","544510","547435","553692","553699","548112","548011","553934"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["development","house","layout","street","backyard","interconnect","community","become","plan","planning"]}
