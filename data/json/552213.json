{"path":"552213.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts a river, partially covered with ice, flowing through a landscape. The view is from an elevated perspective, looking along the river as it moves away from the viewer towards a pair of industrial structures in the distance. The waters of the river appear rough and turbulent with patches of white ice and darker areas of moving water, creating a textured appearance.\n\nThe sky, overcast and gray, suggests a cold, gloomy day. The edges of the riverbanks are not clearly visible, indicating the photograph was taken during a time when the daylight is fading, possibly dusk. There are no visible human activities or people; the focus is entirely on the natural and industrial elements of the scene.\n\nIn the distance beyond the river, silhouetted against the sky, are industrial structures which might be part of a dam, bridge, or some other form of infrastructure, adding a hint of human presence in this otherwise natural landscape.\n\nOverall, the photo conveys a sense of quiet and isolation, emphasizing the rugged beauty of a winter river scene amidst an industrial backdrop.","title":"Waste pulping water is released after secondary treatment into a slough in the Snohomish estuary.
