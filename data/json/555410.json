{"path":"555410.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a tall, vertical sign installed on a street, likely outside a business specializing in signage and lighting, known as \"Multi-Light Broadway Signs.\" The sign is composed of multiple panels stacked vertically, each featuring part of the business's name in a bold, black font against a light background. These panels have a decorative, somewhat retro design, incorporating angular and zig-zag motifs that suggest a mid-20th-century style.\n\nBelow the business name, the sign includes a large, prominent clock with a yellow rim and the time hands indicating it is just past ten o'clock. Underneath the clock, there is another panel with a message that reads \"MEMO TO GOV TOM: GENESIS 1:3\", presented in simple capitalized red lettering against a white background.\n\nThe background of the photo shows a sky with some clouds, hinting that the photograph was taken during the day under partly cloudy conditions. The lighting and angle create a dramatic and somewhat vintage feel, emphasizing the verticality and graphic elements of the signage. The content and styling of the sign, along with the text referencing a biblical verse, suggest a thematic or promotional intention beyond mere business advertisement.","title":"Not all businessmen agreed with the Oregon governor's executive order curtailing neon and commercial lighting.
