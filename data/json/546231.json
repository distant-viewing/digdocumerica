{"path":"546231.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, sprawling landfill, overflowing with assorted debris and waste materials. There are three prominent earthmoving vehicles operating in the scene. The nearest one, a bulldozer, is positioned in the foreground with its scoop full, pushing large amounts of trash. A person is visible sitting atop this bulldozer, managing its operation. This adds a human element to the otherwise mechanical and industrial scene.\n\nIn the background, two more heavy vehicles are engaged in similar activities; one seems like a dump truck, poised near a dirt mound possibly ready to unload or has just unloaded. The environment is quite harsh and bleak with no visible vegetation, under a clear sky which suggests a dry, sunny day. The landscape is dominated by mounds of waste including boxes, miscellaneous debris, and other discarded items, indicating the massive scale of waste management operations. The general tone of the photograph is busy and somewhat chaotic, providing a stark visualization of the environmental impact of human waste.","title":"City sanitary landfill operation.
