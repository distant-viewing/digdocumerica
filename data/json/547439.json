{"path":"547439.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures an isolated church settled against a dark, textural background. The church, which is the central subject of the photograph, appears small but distinct, with its structure highlighted by a soft illumination that contrasts sharply with the surrounding darkness. The architecture of the church is traditional, featuring a steeply pitched roof and a prominent, slender steeple topped with what appears to be a cross. The fa√ßade of the church includes a simple arched doorway, possibly with a small window just above it.\n\nThe background consists of a uniformly dark, granular texture that could be a heavily shadowed landscape or a deteriorated photograph surface, creating an almost abstract effect. This uniformity draws attention to the brightness of the church, making it seem almost ethereal or surreal in its isolation and lighting.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of solitude and perhaps spirituality, emphasized by the stark contrast between the lit church and the undistinguishable dark backdrop. This setting evokes a sense of peace and stillness, typical of a sacral building located away from bustling urban settings. The composition, focusing tightly on the church with a vast expanse of darkness around, reinforces themes of isolation and contemplation.","title":"Abandoned church at dusk on north side of interstate 80","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["554035","547346","546455","556480","558024","545366","550376","557088","546466","554000","547332","543353","554207","558023","557758","558034"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["church","darkness","arched","settle","isolation","uniformity","isolated","steeple","deteriorate","peace"]}
