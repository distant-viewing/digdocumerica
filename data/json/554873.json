{"path":"554873.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a nostalgic American scene, likely from the mid-20th century, marked by a sense of everyday life and a slice of Americana.\n\nIn the foreground, a woman rides a motorcycle towards the camera. Her style is casual, with her hair styled in a manner typical of her era. She is riding a chopper-style motorcycle which suggests a sense of freedom and adventure often associated with American bike culture of the past.\n\nBehind her, the scene is defined by a classic American gas station branded with the Mobil oil company’s signage, recognizable by its red Pegasus logo and the prominent “Mobil” text on a sign that also advertises “Credit Cards Honored Here.” A series of gas pumps are visible in front of the station.\n\nTo the left of the gas station, there is a parked car with a distinctive 1960s design, enhancing the retro feel of the scene. An assortment of other people are visible throughout; notably, two men are engaged in mechanical work or maintenance near another car, embodying a common sight of hands-on maintenance work at gas stations during this era.\n\nThe gas station itself appears to have a small shop attached to it, typical of roadside service stations of the time, possibly selling snacks and car-related products. The overall environment features trees and a slightly overcast sky, suggesting a tranquil yet slightly cloudy day. Power lines and other roadside infrastructure are visible, setting the scene in a semi-rural or small-town context.","title":"Motorcyclist in Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["554874","549003","550096","547866","555517","554875","555457","554784","555484","554871","555506","557766","555467","548889","554898","546184"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["gas","station","motorcycle","roadside","pumps","maintenance","embody","car","era","style"]}
