{"path":"554347.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of the ground, focusing on a distinctly textured surface which seems to be a mixture of cracked mud and puddles of water. The scene is lit in such a way that the water reflects light, creating a contrast with the dark, broken mud around it. The cracks in the mud form a myriad of irregular, polygonal shapes across the scene, varying in size and depth.\n\nThe lighting gives the water a slight shimmer and highlights small details like pebbles and finer sediments scattered on and around the surface. The overall color tone of the image is predominantly dark with hints of blue and gray, suggesting it might be a wet or moist environment possibly after a rain. There’s an overall sense of decay or desolation conveyed by the cracked earth, yet there’s also a subtle beauty in the patterns formed by the natural elements. There are no visible plants or life forms in the immediate area; the focus is solely on the interaction between earth and water. The photo evokes a sense of stillness and quietness, emblematic of a deserted or undisturbed natural landscape.","title":"Dirty, oily water of pond beside autoMobile scrap yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["544176","555545","544992","550837","552066","544184","549201","552983","545850","545597","557417","554778","543523","553581","544733","545656"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mud","crack","form","myriad","earth","quietness","pebble","puddle","shimmer","desolation"]}
