{"path":"547364.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an elder man wearing a denim engineer cap and sunglasses, likely designed for safety or outdoor work. He sports a friendly smile and is dressed in a set of classic bib overalls that feature a vertical striped pattern; the overalls are labeled with \"KEY Imperial,\" suggesting they are likely industrially purposed for rugged work. The suspenders of the overalls are secured with metallic buttons and hooks, and one of the chest pockets appears slightly worn or distressed, indicating regular use.\n\nThe man's accessories include a pen or similar tool clipped over his chest, a functional detail tailored to his activities. His casual pose, with one hand partially visible, suggests a moment of interaction, perhaps during a break in his work. The background is softly blurred with a dimly lit interior setting, allowing the man to be the clear focal point. The soft, natural lighting highlights the textures of his work attire and gently illuminates his features, emphasizing a sense of warmth and approachability in his expression.","title":"Citizen of utica in town store","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547313","547338","547277","542783","557138","554441","544382","558312","547330","547179","547163","548224","552684","553605","549054","549042"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["overall","chest","work","clip","tailor","engineer","buttons","suspender","hook","accessory"]}
