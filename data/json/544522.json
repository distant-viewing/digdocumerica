{"path":"544522.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural landscape primarily composed of a vast grass field under a blue sky dotted with clouds. At the forefront, a metal sign mounted on a black pole stands prominently. The sign, which reads \"U.S. Dept. of the Interior Boundary Line National Park Service,\" indicates a boundary within a protected national park area.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is covered in tall, dense grasses which vary slightly in color from green to brown, suggesting a mix of growth and perhaps seasonal changes. The flat landscape extends into the distance without significant interruption, apart from a few sparse, small trees scattered horizontally across the horizon under the expansive sky.\n\nThis setting appears to be relatively remote and untouched by urban development, emphasizing a natural, undeveloped environment possibly aimed at conservation or land management within a national park. The scene is tranquil, dominated by natural elements, and reflects a clear day with ample sunlight.","title":"One of the northern boundary lines","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["549238","545109","552903","549186","549227","556990","549453","549155","544220","549156","557189","552914","557191","549236","557188","551370"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["interruption","conservation","grass","aim","protect","park","boundary","change","growth","forefront"]}
