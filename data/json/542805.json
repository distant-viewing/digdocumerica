{"path":"542805.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a rural scene dominated by a large, aged barn that stands prominently in the frame. The barn, painted white but clearly weathered and chipping, features a steep roof and several functional attributes such as a sliding door and upper-level vents. On the front of the barn, a sign reads \"Herbert Hunt Ranch,\" suggesting the barn's affiliation with a private property.\n\nAdjacent to the barn is a wooden fence, typical of those used in farmyards to corral animals. The fence's rustic, sturdy construction matches the aesthetic of the barn, enhancing the rural atmosphere. Within this fenced area, a single horse is positioned. The horse, appearing to be brown in color, stands calmly, contributing to the tranquil and pastoral vibe of the scene.\n\nThe background is lush with dense greenery, primarily trees, indicating that the barn is situated in a heavily wooded area or near a forest. The lighting suggests that the photograph might have been taken during daylight with clear skies, as the scene is well-lit and shadows from the barn and fence are visible on the ground.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph—the rustic barn, the wooden fence, the lone horse, and the wooded backdrop—collectively portrays a serene and somewhat nostalgic snapshot of rural life, highlighting elements typical of a working ranch.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556586","552537","550019","554782","555577","552462","554161","556963","549194","555571","552562","555538","555627","547128","552448","555646"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","horse","fence","affiliation","ranch","vent","property","vibe","snapshot","animal"]}
