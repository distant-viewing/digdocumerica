{"path":"548502.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene aboard a sailboat named \"Stinker Too AYC,\" situated on calm waters. Six individuals, a mix of men and women, are enjoying a leisurely day out sailing. \n\nIn the foreground, one man is seated on the bow of the boat, wearing sunglasses and shorts, and is drinking from a can. Behind him, towards the center of the boat under a white canopy, another man is standing and appears to be handing out drinks to others. This man is dressed in a dark shirt and shorts. \n\nThe rest of the crew, including two women and two more men, are gathered around the cockpit table engaged in conversation and refreshment. The attire is casual, with swimsuits and light summer clothing predominating, suggesting a warm, sunny day. \n\nThe ocean around them is relatively calm, and the haze in the background suggests a bit of humidity or mist in the air. Other sailboats can be faintly seen in the distance, enhancing the nautical theme of the setting.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is one of relaxation and enjoyment as these individuals partake in a day of sailing, surrounded by the beauty of the open water.","title":"Sailboat underway.
