{"path":"556007.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a person's hands and torso while they are in the process of writing or marking a document. The person is dressed in a dark blue uniform with distinctive red and white chevron sleeve patches, indicating a rank or role typical in military or similar organizations. The individual holds a pen in one hand and a paper document in the other. An eraser or small object is also visible in their left hand beside the document, which includes various printed text and lined sections, suggesting it could be an official form or checklist. The foreground is focused entirely on the activity of handling the document, while the background is indistinct, shrouded in darkness which highlights the actions of the person's hands. The setting and attire suggest an environment associated with discipline, possibly a military or structured civilian role.","title":"Conductor at Dodge City, Kansas, punches a ticket for a passenger on an eastbound Southwest Limited.
