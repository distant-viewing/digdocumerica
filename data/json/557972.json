{"path":"557972.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a serene river scene with vivid natural surroundings. The river runs calmly through the image, flanked by lush greenery. A distinctive feature is a collection of numerous small boats or canoes aligned in a staggered arrangement along the bank on the left side of the river, partially submerged or beached with some tilted up into the bushes. The boats display various colors, adding visual interest.\n\nIn the background, dense trees line the opposite shores, suggesting a secluded or less urbanized location. Overhead, the sky appears partly cloudy, with hints of blue peeking through the clouds, providing soft, natural lighting over the scene. Foreground foliage, possibly yellow flowers, slightly obscures the lower part of the view, enhancing the feeling of viewing this peaceful setting from behind natural cover.\n\nNo people are visible in the scene, focusing all attention on the untouched natural beauty and the tranquil mood set by the river and its surroundings. The presence of the boats suggests human activity, possibly recreational, though the immediate moment is quiet and still.","title":"Junked autos line the bank of the Cuyahoga River south of Vaughn Road near Jaite, Ohio, which is south of Cleveland. The river and Cuyahoga Valley are part of the 30,000 acre Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area between Akron and Cleveland. It is the last major undeveloped land remaining between the two cities. The valley is heavily wooded and steeply sloped. The area is rich in Indian history and was important in commerce along the Ohio-Erie Canal in the 19th century.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551217","550769","551209","550989","550988","550000","550208","558064","543444","550656","550839","550844","550773","551281","550845","552108"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","boat","canoe","surrounding","cover","collection","interest","arrangement","bank","feeling"]}
