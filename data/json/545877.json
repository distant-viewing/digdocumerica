{"path":"545877.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a construction scene dominated by contrasting elements of urban development. In the foreground, there is an active construction site marked by a towering black crane. The crane extends across the photo, its long boom angling slightly upward against a vivid blue sky with minimal cloud cover.\n\nThe scene includes two distinctly different buildings in the background. On the left, there is a modern building under construction. Its structure involves vertical steel beams and frameworks, creating an intricate mesh of lines that are yet unfinished and exposed. This building does not exhibit any exterior walls at this stage of construction, indicating ongoing development.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, there is a completed high-rise building with a reflective glass facade. This building's skin mirrors the sky, blending the built environment with the natural light and clouds. The glass exterior is predominantly blue due to the reflection of the sky, integrating a contrasting yet harmonious element to the composition.\n\nThe clouds in the sky enhance the sense of height and depth in the photograph, adding a natural element to the scene dominated by metallic and glass textures. The composition utilizes the juxtaposition of ongoing construction against the completeness of the reflective building, symbolizing perhaps the continuous cycle of urban development and architectural progress.","title":"Skyscrapers and construction","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["550907","547977","546503","555746","556619","549640","548551","544167","546411","549912","545869","547223","549997","549913","547615","547235"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","development","glass","building","crane","cloud","cycle","mesh","boom","progress"]}
