{"path":"547468.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph displays an industrial setting with a large, imposing structure that has several distinct features. The most prominent object in the image is a tall, black chimney emitting smoke, which indicates the structure is likely operational. The chimney is secured by multiple cables or guy-wires, suggesting that stability is a concern, possibly due to its height or the industrial processes. Attached to the chimney is a platform with a railing, possibly for maintenance access.\n\nThe base of the chimney connects to a substantial facility composed of various segments with different functions, indicated by the visible machinery and conveyors. It appears to be comprised of blocky, metallic parts painted in dark and dull colors, primarily blacks and grays, which evoke a sense of heavy industry and manufacturing. The segments are interconnected in a manner that suggests a complex system designed for a specific, possibly heavy-duty industrial process.\n\nThe background features a light, cloudy sky which contrasts with the dark, metallic colors of the industrial machinery and structures, adding a dramatic effect to the scene. This setting does not show any human presence or natural elements, focusing solely on the industrial components, and reflecting an environment devoted purely to industrial or manufacturing purposes.","title":"Auto shredder","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["546760","544777","552184","556499","557387","545472","557373","550344","557302","544958","545236","550998","550982","557299","544035","550939"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["chimney","segment","manufacturing","stability","process","interconnect","machinery","black","conveyor","secure"]}
