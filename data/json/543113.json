{"path":"543113.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scene where an older man, wearing a cap and work attire, operates a large yellow bulldozer named \"International 175 Series B Loader.\" The machinery is dusty and bears signs of heavy use, including stained and weathered surfaces. The loader is equipped with a sizable bucket, raised at the moment, indicating either a pause in work or maneuvering movements.\n\nThe setting is a coastal area, with a sandy and slightly grassy foreground that looks recently disturbed, likely by the same or similar construction activities. In the background, a beach leads to a body of water where three boats are visible, suggesting this area might be near a fishing community or a harbor. Beyond the water, a hill partially obscures the horizon, hinting that the location could be part of a larger bay or inlet.\n\nThe sky is generally clear with just a few clouds, which together with the sunlit conditions suggest the photo was taken during a fair weather day. This photograph gives an impression of ongoing development or maintenance work in a coastal environment, blending industrial activity with serene nature.","title":"California--Bodega Bay harbor","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["547151","551947","551262","547186","555601","547939","545664","554544","553619","544138","543114","545665","547161","555636","545652","542539"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["work","loader","pause","inlet","harbor","bulldozer","bay","bucket","fishing","cap"]}
