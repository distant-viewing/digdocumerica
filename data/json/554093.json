{"path":"554093.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an extensive display of large fish, predominantly swordfish, laid out in rows on a surface, presumably for sale or display. The swords of the fish are clearly visible, pointing in various directions, and each fish has a tag attached, possibly indicating weight, price, or origin. The setting appears to be an indoor fish market, evident from the controlled lighting and structural elements like walls and ceiling visible in the background.\n\nIn the background, there are people who seem to be observing or perhaps negotiating purchases. They are standing and walking around the area where the fish are displayed. The crowd consists of a mix of adults dressed in varied attire, suggesting a diverse range of visitors or buyers.\n\nThe overall atmosphere suggests a busy marketplace environment, with a focus on seafood commerce. The colors in the photograph are slightly muted, giving it a somewhat retro or dated feel. The lighting is subdued, emphasizing the textures and details of the fish, and contributing to the moody ambiance of the market scene.","title":"Fish auction is a daily event","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554095","554098","547848","545063","550320","544995","544987","547856","545284","545274","542892","546792","545075","554096","543189","552810"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","market","buyer","marketplace","seafood","origin","purchase","tag","display","weight"]}
