{"path":"555391.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"In the photograph, a person is interacting with a large bulletin board cluttered with numerous slips of paper, most likely notes or messages. The person depicted is dressed in a checkered jacket paired with a white ruffled shirt, giving them a stylish and somewhat formal appearance. They are standing to the right side of the frame, touching and presumably reading or organizing the papers on the board.\n\nThe background shows a simple, subdued green wall above the bulletin board, and a muted tone below it, resembling a typical indoor office or a hallway setting. The extensive presence of the paper slips suggests a busy environment, possibly a place where communication or message-leaving is important, such as a community center, a school, or an office space.\n\nThere's also a small box visible on the lower left corner of the bulletin board, which is possibly used for holding additional notes, pins, or other small items essential for organizing the board. The area does not show much other decoration or distraction, focusing attention clearly on the board and the activity of the person engaged with it. This suggests a functional space primarily used for information sharing or organization.","title":"When the major home oil dealer ran out of fuel a special board was activated for emergency deliveries.
