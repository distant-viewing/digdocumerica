{"path":"545766.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of outdoor adventure in a rugged, desert landscape. The image features a person, turned away from the camera, wearing a large red backpack and standing in a vast expanse of reddish-orange sand and sparse vegetation. The person is wearing shorts, a dark blue shirt, and a sunhat, suitable for a hike under clear, sunny skies.\n\nIn the background, spectacular sandstone rock formations rise dramatically against the blue sky. The rocks are layered with bands of different shades of red and orange, indicative of eroded desert sandstone typically found in regions like Utah or Arizona. To the left of the backpacker, a few gnarled bushes dot the scenery, enhancing the arid and wild nature of the landscape.\n\nIn the midground, a small group of deer can be seen grazing or moving through the underbrush, adding a sense of life and movement to the serene and arid environment. These animals accentuate the natural, untouched feel of the scene.\n\nThis image resonates with themes of exploration, nature, and the great outdoors, showcasing both the beauty of the wild landscapes and the human spirit of adventure.","title":"Hiker in the Maze, a remote and rugged region in the heart of the Canyonlands, encounters some cattle grazing. This area was only recently incorporated into the park, and grazing will be permitted for a few more years. There are indications, however, that in some places the landscape is suffering.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545762","545759","545758","545785","545700","544305","554507","545781","545776","545697","545782","544902","545780","545755","544906","544341"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["sandstone","adventure","desert","underbrush","hike","deer","backpack","rock","band","person"]}
