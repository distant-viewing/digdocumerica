{"path":"545847.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a lush, natural landscape teeming with wildflowers. It features an expansive field filled with dense, vibrant patches of red and yellow flowers, likely Indian Blanket (Gaillardia pulchella), a species known for its showy, daisy-like appearance. The foreground is a rich blanket of these flowers stretching out towards the horizon.\n\nDominating the left side of the image is a large, leafless tree with intricate branching patterns that suggest either a dormant state or the effects of aging. The tree's bare branches provide a stark contrast to the colorful floral display below.\n\nBeyond the tree, the landscape transitions into a more wooded area, with clusters of trees that appear full and green, suggesting a healthy, thriving growth. This variation in vegetation, from the open field to denser woods, adds a layered depth to the scene.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph has a soft quality, possibly indicating a time of day close to morning or late afternoon, where the light casts gentle shadows and enriches the colors of the natural scene.\n\nOverall, this image captures the beauty of a wildflower meadow juxtaposed against the rugged elegance of a leafless tree, set within a tranquil wooded environment, embodying a serene slice of nature.","title":"Mesquite tree, Indian blankets and wild daisies","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["544574","545723","557098","544443","544439","553076","544938","542615","549225","557099","550781","545703","550536","544581","557189","557191"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["wildflower","daisy","flower","tree","elegance","meadow","blanket","field","aging","specie"]}
