{"path":"547180.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet dynamic scene along what appears to be a waterfront walkway or pier. Two people, possibly a couple, are visible walking with their backs toward the camera. Their dark silhouettes contrast with the brighter background, marked by a scattering of sunlit water droplets that create a sparkling effect in the air.\n\nThe atmosphere seems misty or foggy, contributing to the somewhat ethereal quality of the image. The scene's horizontal expanse is bisected by a line of vertical elements in the middle ground—possibly wooden pillars or bollards aligned along the edge of the walkway—forming a rhythmic pattern that guides the eye through the composition. Splashes of water can be seen hitting these structures, possibly due to waves breaking against them.\n\nIn the background, there is a metallic structure, which may be a bridge or a type of navigational framework, featuring rectangular and triangular forms that add an industrial touch to the largely natural scene. To the left, the foliage and debris are coated with a layer of ice or frost, suggesting cold weather conditions and adding a textural contrast to the smoother surfaces of the walkway and water.\n\nThe lighting is subdued yet poignant, highlighting the periphery of the water and ice, which glistens under what is likely the ambient light penetrating a dense fog or mist. The overall mood is one of isolation and tranquility, with human figures and nature coexisting in a moment caught in time.","title":"Icy winds and waves crash against the breakwater at Michigan city","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547099","547217","544315","550234","545911","550240","543950","547143","554919","551957","542993","543203","547044","550014","557572","550937"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["walkway","ice","bollard","frost","scattering","penetrate","periphery","hit","bisect","droplet"]}
