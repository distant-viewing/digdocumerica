{"path":"547062.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a substantial waste processing site, filled with densely packed piles of scrap metal and debris. The debris consists of assorted materials with varied textures and colors, primarily metallic tones interspersed with splashes of rust, blacks, and browns.\n\nIn several sections of the scene, pools of murky water reflect the light, suggesting recent rain or an ongoing issue with drainage. These water bodies occupy irregularly shaped depressions among the piles of metal.\n\nCentral to the image, there are two barges floating in a larger patch of water, laden with yet more scrap. These vessels are painted in bright industrial colors, likely red and white, which starkly contrast with the dull metallics of their cargo.\n\nA dirt path runs through the site, curving around the mounds of scrap and along the edge of the water, signifying some movement and operational activities possibly by heavy machinery. Two earth-moving vehicles, distinguishable by their bright red colors, can be seen on this track, suggesting ongoing work or transportation.\n\nThe environment suggests a focus on industrial activity with no visible vegetation or wildlife, emphasizing the utilitarian nature of the space. The site appears to be an organized yet somewhat chaotic hotspot for scrap processing and recycling activities, handling vast amounts of material with attention to maximizing the use of available space.","title":"Huge dump trucks are the red spots in this aerial of a scrap iron yard on Lake Michigan.","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547611","547610","545059","548315","550880","547625","546256","548422","557308","547054","546255","548362","550350","554301","550882","549818"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["scrap","site","processing","depression","pile","drainage","recycling","black","debris","material"]}
