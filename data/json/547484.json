{"path":"547484.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a heavily damaged car sitting in a desolate area with a view of a water body in the background. The car, which appears to be an older model sedan, is in a state of considerable disrepair. The front windshield is completely missing, and multiple large pieces of the car's frame and body are either bent, broken, or entirely absent. The car's roof is also severely damaged and partially caved in.\n\nThe color palette of the image is dominated by cool tones, with the scene being captured either at twilight or dawn, as indicated by the subdued lighting. The sun, visible in the background between the remnants of the carâ€™s frame, casts a warm glow and creates an atmospheric contrast with the cool shadows.\n\nIn the background, beyond the abandoned vehicle, there is a calm body of water that provides a natural calmness to the scene, juxtaposed with the foreground's chaos. No people are visible in the image, emphasizing the sense of abandonment. The overall feel of the photograph is somber and suggests themes of neglect and decay.","title":"Abandoned auto at fields point on Narragansett bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547481","547835","547601","553007","549107","547839","547597","547911","545304","546318","546315","547605","547587","554302","547923","553010"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","damage","cave","windshield","chaos","body","calmness","disrepair","sedan","remnant"]}
