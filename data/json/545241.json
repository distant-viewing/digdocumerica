{"path":"545241.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene with several juxtaposed elements highlighting industrial and environmental themes. In the foreground, there is a large billboard with the text \"eda New Jobs for your community in partnership with the U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE - Economic Development Administration.\" The sign is visually clean and prominently displayed against a blue sky, suggesting its relatively new or well-maintained status.\n\nBehind the sign, the scene shifts to a stark industrial setting. A large industrial building with multiple structures is visible. Central in the background is a tall smokestack emitting a thick plume of smoke, which starkly contrasts with the message of community development conveyed by the billboard. The background includes a semi-arid landscape with sparse vegetation and some hills, further contexting the industrial facility within a possibly isolated or developing area.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the sign advocating for job creation through economic development with the background imagery of the industrial smokestack, potentially suggesting pollution, creates a thought-provoking contrast. This might imply the complex relationship between industrial development, economic growth, and environmental impact.\n\nThe photograph appears to have been taken during the day under clear skies, giving it a bright and sharp appearance, enhancing the visibility and impact of the contrasting elements within the shot.","title":"Washington--Seattle","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["557296","545989","552190","557373","543013","548968","544736","557374","544039","547198","545013","543009","557225","546141","551054","546236"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["development","billboard","smokestack","administration","status","job","imagery","provoke","sign","relationship"]}
