{"path":"548192.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph shows an aerial view of an orange-brown colored water canal running through a landscape. The canal is relatively narrow and appears straight with slightly curved banks. The color of the water is particularly striking, suggesting a high concentration of pollutants or sediment.\n\nThe canal is flanked on both sides by narrow strips of land, mostly brown, with sparse greenery indicating either an industrial setting or a sparsely populated area. Beyond the banks of the canal, there are patches of grass and scattered bushes.\n\nIn the distance, industrial buildings, various structures, and parking areas can be seen, suggesting the canal may be part of an urban or industrial setting. The background features a hilly landscape with trees and a clear sky.\n\nThe visual perspective is from above, looking down the canal towards the horizon, giving an expansive view that highlights the contrast between the natural landscape and the altered color of the canal water.","title":"Effluent treatment canal at the Crown-Zellerbach Corporation at Camas, one of the largest specialty paper mills in the world.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542510","546206","548896","549032","552733","549076","547948","546868","544654","553428","546125","546116","544536","544702","545927","548949"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["canal","bank","pollutant","sediment","strip","concentration","parking","bush","water","landscape"]}
