{"path":"554410.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a large, rugged rock formation with distinctive textures and markings. The rock surface is primarily dark gray with generic striae and intermittent white quartz veins. The formation is heavily cracked and lined, indicating geological processes, and some parts of the rock display a glossy sheen that could suggest moisture or a particular type of mineral composition.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate presence of the rock, there is a hint of a natural, green landscape. A small portion on the right side of the image shows a grassy slope partially shadowed by adjacent trees. The foliage, lush and green, contrasts starkly with the hard, cold gray of the rock, suggesting this scene might be located in a forested area, possibly within a mountainous or hilly region.\n\nThe perspective and composition focus mainly on the detailed characteristics of the rock, offering a sense of the texture and scale, while only minimally including the gentler, wooded environment that surrounds it. This could be indicative of a natural rocky outcrop exposed in a larger wooded area, typical of environments that experience significant natural erosion and geological activity.","title":"Granite Boulder beside highway 30 on the south end of Tupper Lake.
