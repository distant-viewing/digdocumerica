{"path":"558045.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a scenic rural landscape, likely taken during early autumn given the slight change in tree coloration. The composition includes several key features:\n\n1. Residential Area: Towards the center of the image, there is a cluster of residential buildings including what appears to be a large house with a green roof, accompanied by smaller outbuildings or garages. The area around the buildings is well-maintained, with clear, mowed lawns.\n\n2. Agricultural Elements: Adjacent to the residential area, there's a sizable fenced pasture where several cows can be seen grazing, highlighting the area's agricultural use.\n\n3. Roadways and Paths: A winding road bisects the property, providing access to the buildings and connecting to a more substantial road on the left side of the image that runs parallel to a sequence of trees, possibly indicating another boundary or a scenic route.\n\n4. Vegetation: The surrounding area features dense woodland, which shows signs of season change with a mix of green and a few reddish-brown trees. This natural boundary seems to offer both privacy and a natural aesthetic value to the property.\n\n5. Water Body: On the right side of the image, past the tree line, there's a visible water body, possibly a river or large stream, which further enriches the scenic quality of the landscape.\n\n6. Infrastructure: Along the right boundary, paralleling the water body, is a road or possibly a railway line due to the clear, straight path through the trees, although the exact nature of the track is not distinctly clear from this altitude.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a tranquil and picturesque rural setting, likely aimed at demonstrating a harmonious balance between residential living and nature.","title":"Aerial view of a farm with horses and cattle nestled along the cuyahoga river, south of Cleveland, Ohio.
