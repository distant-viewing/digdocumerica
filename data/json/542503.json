{"path":"542503.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural and agricultural scene showing a biplane in the act of crop dusting. The foreground of the image is filled with lush, green crops that cover the entire landscape. The plane, visible in the center of the image, appears to be just above the crop line, releasing a trail of spray used for either watering or applying pesticides/herbicides to enhance the growth of the crops.\n\nThe plane is a small, classic biplane with two main wings stacked one above the other, which is characteristic of early aviation designs. It emits a cloud of mist behind it, indicating ongoing crop-dusting activities. \n\nThe background is relatively clear and simple, featuring a line of trees that form a somewhat blurred horizon under a bright, blue sky with no visible clouds, suggesting typical fair weather which is ideal for such agricultural activities. The lighting and the colors in the photograph are natural, balanced, and slightly saturated, giving a vivid depiction of an agricultural setting during an active crop dusting operation.","title":"Sulfur-dusting of grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["542504","553044","542495","553873","549072","542508","542505","542506","548902","548903","547297","548820","542502","548950","553048","548898"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["crop","dusting","biplane","plane","pesticide","aviation","act","spray","wing","cloud"]}
