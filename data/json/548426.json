{"path":"548426.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly Black man standing on a city street. He is dressed in a somewhat formal and distinctive manner. He wears a light-colored straw hat, a yellow dress shirt, and a dark pinstriped suit jacket. His shirt is accessorized with a large ruffled yellow front and a large, ornate bow tie. In one hand, he holds a dark cane with a curved handle, and on his left hand he wears a ring. His expression is serious and he is looking directly at the camera.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows a street scene with cars from the 1970s era, some pedestrians at a distance, and the façades of city buildings, which include signs and storefronts. The ambiance suggests an urban environment with active street life. The image captures a sense of personal style and an era-specific urban setting.","title":"'Man on the street'","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556137","543037","556149","556133","545501","556733","554845","552648","556285","555996","556147","547411","553176","557056","547820","547816"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["street","cane","era","accessorize","ring","storefront","city","straw","bow","façade"]}
