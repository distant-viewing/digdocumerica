{"path":"553477.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This image depicts a scene of urban decay and construction or demolition. In the foreground, a large, leafless tree partially obscures the view of a brick building that is in a state of disrepair or mid-demolition. The building has significant structural damageâ€”many bricks are missing, revealing the inner wooden framework and leaving ragged gaps in the walls.\n\nOn the roof of the building, two individuals are visible. They appear to be engaged in some kind of physical labor, possible construction or demolition work, as they seem to be working amidst the debris and damaged structure.\n\nThe background shows a contrasting scene of more intact buildings, including a tall structure with Gothic or Art Deco architectural elements. This backdrop gives a context of an urban environment, possibly undergoing renovation or clearing in certain areas.\n\nThe photograph has a slightly desolate, melancholic feel, emphasized by the muted colors and the visible wear and destruction of the foreground building. The presence of the workers suggests ongoing efforts to deal with the decay, either through clearing away the old or preparing for new construction.","title":"Mulky square is a neighborhood in the west side of Kansas City, an area of low-income dwellings.
