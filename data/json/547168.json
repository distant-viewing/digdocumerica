{"path":"547168.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph presents an interesting and slightly abstract nighttime scene dominated by layers of contrasting textures and colors. In the foreground, thereâ€™s a roadway viewed in a perspective that shows several lanes divided by white lane markings. The road appears to be typical asphalt with some noticeable cracking and repairing. Just beyond the road, there is a red-colored strip which might be a textured surface or landscaped area. \n\nFollowing this, there's a dark expanse, possibly a grassy area or a shadowed zone, that blends into the almost indiscernible background under the dim lighting conditions; only a few sparse, thin trees or poles are faintly visible. In the uppermost layer of the image, there's a brighter reddish pattern that could be either lights, a ceiling, or some sort of canopy, adding a mysterious or artistic frame to the scene. \n\nThe photo might be taken from an elevated position or a bridge overlooking this section of roadway and the adjacent areas, capturing a sense of isolation and calmness that one might experience late at night on an empty urban street. There is no human activity visible in the image, reinforcing a sense of quietness and stillness.","title":"Highway and waterway","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["546744","555431","546586","546401","543957","556983","549846","547659","546575","545451","545367","547051","544009","549543","557277","551239"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["roadway","lane","might","quietness","layer","asphalt","calmness","repair","overlook","strip"]}
