{"path":"547664.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a barren, underdeveloped landscape, likely a construction site or recently cleared land for development. The terrain is predominantly rocky and barren, with dirt tracks suggesting recent vehicular movement. Scattered across the foreground are various sizes of rocks and some debris, indicating minimal landscaping or site preparation.\n\nIn the middle of the image, three houses are visible, each at varying distances from the perspective of the viewer. The nearest house, on the right, is a two-story structure with a dark facade and white trim around the windows and roof. It has an outward appearance of being recently constructed or in the final stages of completion, as it lacks any landscaping or external development.\n\nTo the left and further in the background, two more houses are visible, both appearing similar in architectural style but varying in color and size. One is smaller and white; the one furthest away appears similar in style to the nearest house but is painted a light tan or beige color.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, indicating a day with good weather, which enhances the visibility of the buildings and the starkness of the undeveloped land. There are no visible trees, gardens, or other greenery, suggesting this area is either in the early stages of development or located in a region with sparse vegetation. The overall ambiance points to a setting undergoing transition, poised for further construction and development, but currently stark and somewhat unwelcoming.","title":"Housing development at Point Judith, on Block Island Sound","placename":"Narragansett (R.I.)","location":"Narragansett, Rhode Island","nn1":["547652","547863","553130","548760","554547","544816","547914","557455","546765","553938","544118","544812","557550","557456","544137","553125"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["development","house","landscaping","stage","completion","tan","starkness","size","site","poise"]}
