{"path":"543802.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a man examining the ground in an outdoor setting. The man, who appears middle-aged, is wearing a light-colored hard hat, a short-sleeve shirt, jeans, and a wristwatch. He is crouched down, touching and inspecting a large, shallow impression in sandy soil, which could be an animal track or a geological feature. His expression is focused and contemplative.\n\nThe background shows a natural landscape which appears somewhat barren or eroded. Sparse vegetation, mainly grass, is visible. In the middle distance, there is a rocky or hilly terrain with a noticeable lack of dense vegetation. The sky is overcast, contributing to the overall muted tones of the scene.\n\nThis setting suggests that the man might be engaged in a field study related to geology, archaeology, or environmental science, given his attire and the specific focus on the ground. The location feels remote and somewhat wild, typical of areas used for scientific fieldwork or exploration.","title":"New seeding on uranium tailing pile at Union Carbide plant","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["558108","549083","549086","544094","552289","544920","545269","542548","555824","552290","546262","542716","544085","557097","542601","552110"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["geology","science","wristwatch","fieldwork","crouch","erode","inspect","study","man","examine"]}
