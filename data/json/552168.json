{"path":"552168.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a large, circular settling basin, likely used in industrial or water treatment processes. The basin is surrounded by a sturdy wall and contains a grayish liquid with a visible darker patch swirling at the center. At the center of the basin, there appears to be a mechanical structure, possibly for stirring or monitoring the contents of the basin.\n\nLeading off from the basin is a long, narrow walkway connecting to a rectangular building positioned at the edge of the basin, which may be used for operational control or storage. The surrounding area is rugged and uneven, primarily dirt and rock, with some scattered debris. Directly beyond the constructed infrastructure, the terrain turns rough with patches of water or moisture pockets visible.\n\nThe photograph captures a utilitarian setting focused on industrial function, absent of any vegetation or significant landscape features. The area outside the basin and the central facility appears underdeveloped and bears the marks of industrial usage, potentially reflecting a dry environment due to the presence of dirt and sparse vegetation.","title":"Pulp waste water clarifier at crown zellerbach mill","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543570","545840","542530","547568","543572","551611","543810","548212","557249","548216","544044","552984","550720","544569","543524","545836"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["basin","stir","dirt","pocket","monitor","liquid","treatment","usage","moisture","swirl"]}
