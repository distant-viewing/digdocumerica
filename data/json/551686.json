{"path":"551686.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant, bustling street scene, likely from a street fair or outdoor market, viewed from an elevated balcony adorned with bright red flowers. The setting appears to be an urban, leafy neighborhood with older, well-maintained buildings lining the street.\n\nOn the street below, numerous people can be seen engaging in various activities. Some individuals are walking, seemingly browsing through the items displayed on the tables covered with green tablecloths along the sidewalk. These tables hold a variety of items for sale, which appear to include books, dishes, and other miscellaneous objects that might be found at a flea market or street sale.\n\nIn the middle distance, thereâ€™s a focal point where a group of people gathers around what seems to be a statue or a decorative piece on the sidewalk. More people are scattered throughout the scene, contributing to a lively and communal atmosphere.\n\nThe buildings along the street have a classic architectural style, some with steps leading up to the entrance, and the foliage of mature trees provides a canopy that adds a sense of tranquility and shade to the urban environment.\n\nAdditionally, there is a bicycle rider in the foreground, which, coupled with the lack of visible vehicular traffic, suggests that the street may be temporarily closed off for pedestrian activities, enhancing the community atmosphere of the event. The sky is partly obscured by the foliage but appears clear, suggesting a pleasant weather day conducive to an outdoor event.","title":"Block party on east 35th street between Lexington and Madison avenues.
