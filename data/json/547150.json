{"path":"547150.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a person standing on a wet wooden pier or dock overlooking a rough sea. The person is looking towards the water where large waves are visible crashing against the shore or breakwaters, creating a misty spray. The individual is dressed in cold weather attire, featuring blue jeans, a heavy green coat with a fur-lined hood, and dark boots. The coat's hood is pulled up over their head to protect against the cold weather. The environment suggests a chilly or windy day, as evidenced by the clothing worn and the rough sea conditions. The sky above is partly cloudy, allowing some sunlight through but mostly providing a moody, overcast ambiance to the scene.","title":"Gale-whipped waves break over the seawall at Michigan City","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547087","547118","547562","542976","554004","545086","545103","544203","543153","551946","547155","547100","543048","543241","550310","543465"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["hood","coat","breakwater","sea","fur","weather","spray","person","boot","pier"]}
