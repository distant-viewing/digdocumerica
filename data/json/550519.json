{"path":"550519.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial or satellite image of a rugged, mountainous landscape. The land is deeply incised by numerous sinuous river channels and valleys that create an intricate network, reminiscent of a branching tree or veins. The colors are quite muted with varying shades of dark greens and grays, indicating either dense vegetation or shadowed areas interspersed with bright white lines that could either be rivers filled with water or perhaps areas reflecting the sun more strongly, which could imply they are rocky or barren. The overall appearance is both natural and untouched, providing a sense of the topographic complexity and remote nature of the terrain. There are no signs of human habitation or activity visible in this imageâ€”no buildings, roads, or other infrastructure, enhancing its wild, pristine character. The emphasis on texture and natural patterns gives the image a striking abstract quality.","title":"Braided channels of the Dietrich, a typical northern river along the pipeline route. The channels are not apparent until late summer, since in spring the rivers generally run full from melting snow. Like the other rivers, the Dietrich will serve as a source of gravel for construction; the dark areas shown here are gravel bars. In this southern view, the pipeline will run along the left (east) margin of the river.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552426","550596","550395","550512","550529","550517","550498","552548","550523","545807","542991","555677","550507","550522","542821","550418"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["vein","channel","river","habitation","emphasis","complexity","character","network","gray","valley"]}
