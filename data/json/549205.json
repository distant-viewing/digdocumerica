{"path":"549205.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph shows a rugged, muddy landscape featuring deeply rutted dirt tracks, indicative of heavy vehicle activity. The foreground prominently displays the earth-heavy tracks that curve slightly and lead toward the middle of the image. These tracks are filled with dried mud, emphasizing their frequent use.\n\nIn the middle distance, a horizontally oriented building and several pieces of heavy construction machinery, including what appears to be a bulldozer, are visible. This suggests that the area is possibly a construction site or involved in land reclamation or similar earth-moving activities.\n\nThe backdrop consists of a gently rolling hill dotted with trees and a cloudy sky above. The environment surrounding the disturbed earth hints at a rural or semi-rural setting, possibly a location where forestry or extensive land modification tasks are being conducted. The presence of clouds in a blue sky adds a bit of dramatism to the otherwise earthy and industrial scene.","title":"A railroad is being constructed through the sarpy basin area to transport coal from the westmoreland coal company","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["547523","552814","543785","555608","556456","554809","547254","543105","553378","549255","545665","543112","554547","545533","547979","548807"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["track","earth","reclamation","modification","construction","involved","land","featuring","forestry","conduct"]}
