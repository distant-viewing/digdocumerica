{"path":"545021.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a traditional outdoor cooking setup focused on gyros, a popular Greek dish. The cooking device comprises a circular, black metal base filled with glowing charcoal briquettes that provide the heat. In the center of this base, a vertical rotisserie spindle is actively roasting a large mass of marinated meat, presumably gyros. The meat is encased in a metallic cage that helps to maintain its shape and evenly cook it as it rotates.\n\nFlanking the rotisserie on each side are large pieces of bread, possibly pita or another type of flatbread, propped upright and wrapped in aluminum foil. The bread is being toasted by the heat radiating from the central meat, which allows it to capture some of the flavors being emitted. The foil likely helps in retaining moisture and heat, ensuring that the bread remains soft and warm.\n\nThe background is softly focused but features what appears to be a grassy area with hints of a wooden structure, possibly a fence or deck, suggesting that this cooking setup is situated in a backyard or outdoor patio environment. The overall scene conveys a sense of rustic and homely outdoor cooking, likely in preparation for a communal meal.","title":"Salmon bake","placename":"Otter Crest (Or.)","location":"Otter Crest, Oregon","nn1":["546127","544983","545017","557793","557934","557801","544974","544986","550081","550085","551275","549451","544979","543987","551844","557700"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["cooking","meat","heat","base","setup","cage","patio","aluminum","dish","backyard"]}
