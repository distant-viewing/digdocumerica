{"path":"557375.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a moody and atmospheric industrial scene, dominated by a factory or plant of some sort amidst a rugged landscape. The backdrop consists of densely wooded hills which fade into mist, creating a sense of depth and isolation.\n\nIn the foreground, the focus is on an industrial complex, characterized by various structures including tall smokestacks, which are actively emitting white smoke. A significant amount of smoke and steam is also seen enveloping the scene, inferring ongoing industrial processes. The buildings are constructed of dark materials and have a utilitarian design, typical of mid-20th century industrial architecture.\n\nTo the right, a prominent feature in the image is a water tower, further solidifying the self-contained nature of this industrial setup. Railroad tracks curve gently through the left side of the frame, suggesting the transport of goods or raw materials in and out of the plant.\n\nThe overall tone of the image is subdued, with a bluish tint overlay that could signify either the time of day (perhaps dawn or dusk) or a photographic filter that emphasizes the shadows and industrial emissions. The air appears thick with mist and smoke, hinting at either early morning moisture or the byproducts of the plant's operations. The image evokes a strong sense of place and time, reflecting industrial activity in a secluded, possibly mountainous region.","title":"Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant. Emissions from the plant have been reduced since it was first photographed in June, 1973. Decrease in pollution occurred after agreement on a compliance schedule between Union Carbide and the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stack sampled plant emissions while developing national new source performance standards. (See images 8496-98)","placename":"Alloy (W.
