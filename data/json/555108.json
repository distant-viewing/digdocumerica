{"path":"555108.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a dense cluster of coniferous trees. The predominant colors in the image are varying shades of dark green, which suggest a healthy, lush environment. The trees are tightly packed, with the canopy almost entirely blocking any view of the sky or ground beneath. The focal point of the image is perhaps a slightly taller tree toward the center, which stands out due to its slightly lighter colored foliage and more pronounced central trunk. The photograph exudes a calm and serene ambiance, typical of a deep forest setting. The lighting suggests daylight conditions, however, the dense foliage casts significant shadow, softening the overall brightness of the scene. No human activity or artificial structures are visible, underscoring the natural and untouched character of the scene.","title":"Mixed stand of western red cedar, hemlock and Douglas fir in Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
