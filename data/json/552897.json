{"path":"552897.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a vast desert landscape at twilight, showing a serene and expansive view. The foreground features a rugged terrain filled with dense, scrubby shrubbery typical of arid environments. A narrow, winding dirt path cuts through the shrubs, leading the viewer's eye into the scene.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by an open flat plain that extends towards the background, bordered by distant mountains that line the horizon. The mountains appear smoothed by distance, and their contours are gently highlighted by the fading light.\n\nThe sky, covering a significant part of the composition, is painted with soft hues ranging from deep blues to subtle pinks and purples, suggesting the photo was taken near sunset. The clouds are sparse and streaky, contributing to the tranquil and expansive feel of the scene.\n\nOverall, this photograph depicts a quiet, natural setting that is typical of desert ecosystems, emphasizing vastness and the subtle interplay of light and color in a serene landscape.","title":"Looking west across the desert from the south end of Pyramid Lake at dawn","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["547717","544027","545752","545761","545895","545748","545771","545207","545575","552923","545789","544071","545843","548230","557627","544016"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["desert","smooth","scrubby","pink","mountain","fading","plain","shrubbery","purple","twilight"]}
