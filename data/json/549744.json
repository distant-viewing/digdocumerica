{"path":"549744.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a flock of seagulls in mid-flight congregating and swooping in a tumultuous, cluttered setting, likely a garbage dump as suggested by the heap of assorted waste materials visible. The scene spans from the foreground, filled with flying seagulls and mounds of rubbish, to a blurred urban backdrop. In the background, you can see a large, flat-topped high-rise building that looms over the scene, reinforcing the juxtaposition between natural wildlife and urban development. The image conveys a gritty, somewhat surreal atmosphere, possibly highlighting themes of nature's adaptation to human environments or the impact of urban sprawl. The lighting suggests the photo might have been taken on a bright, clear day, contributing to the sharp visibility of the scattered debris and birds.","title":"In time this Hackensack dump will provide park and other recreational facilities to bergen county residents","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["549758","549738","549742","549952","554542","549757","549951","553347","554600","547971","552238","549953","546759","549754","549766","552146"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["seagull","flock","rubbish","adaptation","dump","mounds","loom","assort","heap","fly"]}
