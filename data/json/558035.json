{"path":"558035.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a traditional two-story brick house. The architectural style has a Gothic influence, evident from the pointed arch window on the upper story and the ornamental sawtooth brick detailing under the roof gable. The house is painted in a rich red brick color and features white trim around the windows and doors, which adds a contrasting element.\n\nIn front of the house, there is a covered porch area supported by columns, providing a sheltered outdoor space. The house is positioned amidst a well-manicured lawn, with a lush green appearance, indicating well-maintained grounds. To the right, there is a large, mature tree that towers over the house, suggesting a long-established landscape. The tree has dense foliage that brings a touch of nature to the residential setting.\n\nThe background is simple, hosting additional greenery that further contributes to the serene, suburban environment. The light conditions suggest it is a clear and sunny day, given the brightness and vividness of the colors in the image. The overall setting is peaceful and quaint, typical of a well-kept residential area.","title":"The old Conger home on Riverview Road in Peninsula, Ohio near Akron, is privately owned and was recently Renovated.
