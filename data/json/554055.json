{"path":"554055.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic, expansive agricultural landscape. The fields are arranged in neat rows, creating a pattern of stripes that vary in color from deep red to lighter shades, suggesting different types of soil or crop stages. The area appears to be a large farm with the land gently undulating into small hills and valleys.\n\nIn the foreground, the fields are planted with crops that appear to be young, showing sparsely distributed greenery across the rich, reddish-brown earth. Progressing into the middle ground, the fields' colors transition into a blend of deeper reds and browns, with some areas showing circular patterns that suggest a methodical approach to planting or watering.\n\nScattered across the fields are several structures, possibly for storage or shelter, and some machinery, possibly for farming, indicating ongoing agricultural activity. These small, dark-colored outbuildings and machines contrast with the vast, open fields.\n\nTowards the background, there's a line of trees providing a slight break in the expanse of the fields. Further back, the landscape meets a large body of water, providing a stunning blue contrast to the earthy tones of the fields. The water body meets the horizon under a clear sky, which suggests a view toward a large lake or the ocean.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its vast open fields in the front and water at the back, coupled with a clear sky, conveys a sense of serene, rural life, meticulously organized around farming and agriculture, all set in a large, open landscape.","title":"Aerial view of a tract of pineapple saved from urban development. Maui land developers petitioned the Land Use Commission (LUC) for reclassification of 659 agricultural acres. In August, 1970, the LUC approved only 300 acres. The decision was applauded by those who fear overdevelopment of the fast-growing area.","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["554029","554027","554030","542708","552858","552466","555641","554015","553977","544552","549094","548907","547426","557517","558414","548908"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["field","farming","crop","red","outbuilding","approach","shelter","agriculture","pattern","break"]}
