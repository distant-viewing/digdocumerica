{"path":"548570.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a cheerful and colorful scene of older adults, likely from a retirement community, riding modified tricycle bikes along a street. Each tricycle is equipped with a small American flag, and the back of each bike features a nameplate identifying the rider with charming names like \"Ethel,\" \"Kate,\" \"Ruby,\" etc.\n\nThe riders are dressed in casual and light clothing suitable for a sunny day. Several wear hats or headscarves, and their outfits vary in color and pattern, contributing to the festive atmosphere. The women's tricycles are adorned with baskets on the back, some of which hold personal items and even a pair of red apples.\n\nIn the background, there is a construction site, possibly within or adjacent to their community. Visible are a crane, various construction materials, and a red cement-mixer truck, which contrast with the leisurely and playful foreground activity.\n\nThe setting suggests a community-focused environment with ongoing development or maintenance, highlighting a juxtaposition between active senior lifestyles and the changing infrastructure around them. The sky is partly cloudy, casting soft light over the scene, enhancing the sense of a vibrant, active community life.","title":"Tricycle club of the Century Village retirement community meets each morning","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["548572","548573","548574","551545","548625","548647","551504","544369","555499","555500","550679","552625","552626","548569","548646","548588"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["tricycle","bike","community","rider","back","cement","headscarf","construction","basket","lifestyle"]}
