{"path":"551900.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an office setting, likely from the mid to late 20th century, featuring two men working at a control panel station. The focus of the image is on the man in the foreground, who is dressed in a white shirt with a tie and an emblem on his shirt pocket, suggesting a uniform, perhaps of a technical or engineering profession. His gaze is directed toward a complex control panel in front of him, filled with numerous buttons and switches, indicating an environment related to telecommunications, broadcasting, or computing.\n\nThe man is actively engaging with the panel, with one hand placed on a large array of buttons. On top of the panel, there is a desk area where several items including a notepad, two coiled telephone handsets, some paper documents, and a few pieces of electronic equipment are placed. These items suggest tasks involving monitoring, communication, and data processing.\n\nIn the background, another man, who also wears a similar uniform, is seated at a similar but separate control panel. He appears more relaxed and is slightly turned away from the camera, gazing towards what may be a monitor or another operational feature out of the photograph's view.\n\nThe setting is described by simple and unobtrusive décor—plain walls and floor that don't attract attention, focusing the viewer on the activities of the subjects and the technical environment. This setting, combined with the equipment and the attire of the individuals, suggests a setting like a TV broadcast control room, a data processing center, or another type of operations center from the era.","title":"The central police control station, manned 24 hours a day, controls all traffic lights, receives remote TV inputs from major intersections, and maintains radio contact with all traffic control vehicles.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["555334","551904","551905","551902","545952","552377","551901","542659","551916","547720","551903","549367","542765","551896","549378","557394"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["panel","control","button","uniform","processing","telecommunication","tv","décor","monitor","profession"]}
