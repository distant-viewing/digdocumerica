{"path":"552383.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features two individuals interacting with a bright yellow helicopter on a clear day. The helicopter, prominently labeled with the registration number \"N5812Z,\" is stationed on a paved surface, likely a helipad. It has a large rotor on top and a streamlined, modern look. There are various emblems and markings on the helicopter, including one that seems to be a logo with a green circular background, suggesting it might belong to a specific organization or agency.\n\nOne person, wearing a suit with red and black colors, is standing and appears to be entering or exiting the helicopter through the open door. This individual is facing away from the viewer, showing only the backside. The second figure, dressed in a white protective suit, is assisting the first by holding what appears to be a clear plastic bag or cover, possibly containing equipment or personal belongings.\n\nThe background is plain and unfocused, predominantly featuring a clear blue sky with light haze, emphasizing the main action around the helicopter. The overall setting suggests a scenario involving professionals, possibly in fields such as medicine, emergency services, or another form of expedited transportation, preparing for or concluding a flight operation.","title":"Los angeles reactive pollutant program (larpp), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the coordinating research council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["546683","555825","542576","546688","548911","545638","545642","552366","552365","552370","552393","548815","552372","542499","542498","545637"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["helicopter","suit","rotor","registration","belonging","emergency","belong","emblem","organization","exit"]}
