{"path":"549849.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a densely packed urban street scene, most likely from the viewpoint of a high-rise building. The focus is on a bustling street filled with heavy traffic congestion. Numerous vehicles, predominantly cars including several yellow cabs, are either in motion or stuck in traffic. The road is flanked on both sides by tall buildings typical of an urban setting, characterizing a cityscape.\n\nThe left side of the image shows smaller buildings, possibly commercial in nature, with visible signage and active street-level interactions. The right side of the image presents a taller, beige-colored building with uniform, rectangular windows. The inhabitants or activities inside the windows are not visible, but the fa√ßade suggests a residential or office building.\n\nAt the street level, numerous pedestrians can be observed. People appear to be engaging in typical city activities, likely walking or waiting to cross the street, contributing to the lively urban atmosphere.\n\nThe color palette of the scene is somewhat subdued with a lot of grey and muted tones, suggesting either the type of film used or the weather conditions at the time of the photograph. The overall mood feels dynamic yet congested, capturing a moment that speaks to the hustle and bustle of city life, potentially during rush hour.","title":"Looking down on Sixth Avenue traffic at 40th Street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549874","553893","552711","553845","548410","548419","554310","555782","556681","552710","549863","546707","554314","556732","556729","556195"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["street","level","traffic","inhabitant","building","rush","cab","bustle","congestion","hustle"]}
