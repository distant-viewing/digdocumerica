{"path":"552241.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a perspective under a wooden pier or dock, defined by numerous vertical wooden posts supporting the structure above. The lighting beneath the pier creates an interplay of shadows and highlights on the sandy ground, drawing interesting patterns. The brightness suggests a sunny day, with sunlight filtering through gaps between the beams overhead and casting sharp, elongated shadows aligned parallel across the sandy surface. \n\nThe photo's composition uses a high contrast between the dark, shadowed wooden structures and the brightly lit sandy floor. The ground is textured, with some visible rocks and natural debris, characterizing a beach or riverside setting. There appears to be an open space in the background that is partially visible through the wooden columns, suggesting a view toward a body of water or a more open sandy area.\n\nThe viewpoint is from within the shaded area looking outward, creating a sense of enclosure and focusing the viewer's attention on the pattern of light and structure. Overall, the photograph has a quiet and somewhat abstract quality, emphasizing texture, geometric patterns, and the interplay of light and shadow.","title":"Pumping waste water in Bellingham Waterway, site of the Georgia Pacific pulp mill and other industrial plants.
