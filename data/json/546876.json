{"path":"546876.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial waterfront scene, captured on an overcast day. The image shows a canal or river that runs through the center of the frame, with calm water reflecting ambient light. Edges of floating ice or debris are visible near the foreground, enhancing the chilly, industrial ambiance.\n\nOn either side of the canal, there are industrial structures, likely warehouses or manufacturing buildings, characterized by their robust, brick architecture with visible chimneys and large windows. To the right side of the waterway, an assortment of shipping materials, such as lumber and crates, are neatly stacked alongside dock areas.\n\nIn the distance, centered along the waterway, a large ship is moored. The ship appears large and heavy, possibly a freighter or cargo ship, and it dominates the middle portion of the scene. The horizon is also lined with various other cranes and maritime equipment, suggesting ongoing loading or unloading activities.\n\nThe sky is overcast, casting a diffuse light over the scene, and the overall color palette of the photograph is dominated by muted blues, grays, and browns, lending a stark, somber tone to the image. The elements within the photograph suggest a working industrial waterfront, busy yet paused, possibly hinting at the economic activities that are central to this area.","title":"A screen placed across Jones Falls traps trash and keeps it out of Baltimore Harbor.
