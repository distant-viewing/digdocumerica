{"path":"557955.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a group of adults at a casual outdoor gathering, likely a picnic, set in a lush park environment. The scene includes four individuals engaged in various activities:\n\n1. On the left side, a woman seated on a wooden picnic table sips from a white cup. She is dressed in a light pink outfit and a patterned blouse or jacket. In front of her is a picnic setup with items like a wicker basket, white containers, and plates, with a red and white checkered tablecloth adding a classic picnic vibe to the setting.\n\n2. In the center, two men are standing and conversing. The man on the left wears glasses, a short-sleeved white shirt, and light-colored pants; he is holding a white cup as well. The man on the right is similarly dressed, also in a white short-sleeved shirt with a striped tie, and he appears to be talking while making a point with his hand.\n\n3. To the right, another woman, also seated on the picnic table, is actively engaged in either setting out or packing up items on another red and white checkered tablecloth. She is dressed in a light-colored suit, coordinating with the casual yet neat appearance of the group.\n\nIn the background, a notable architectural element is visible: a large building with a distinctive, wide, sloping roof that spans much of the frame, suggesting that the location might be a park or a designed outdoor area possibly near a cultural or civic building. The environment is green and tranquil, adding to the serene, sociable atmosphere of the gathering.","title":"Two couples picnic before a concert at the Blossom Music Center, near Akron, Ohio.
