{"path":"545390.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a man standing outdoors during the daytime. The man is positioned in the left foreground and is partially framed from the side, facing toward the right of the image. He has a medium-dark complexion and is wearing a yellow short-sleeved shirt. His arms are crossed over his chest in a relaxed stance, and he carries a somber expression on his face.\n\nIn the background, the environment appears to be rural or semi-rural, featuring an open, dusty road that leads towards an industrial facility visible in the far background. The facility emits large plumes of dark smoke, which rise into the clear blue sky dominating the upper portion of the image. The vegetation around the path is sparse, including some low bushes and grass. To the right, behind the man, there appears to be the top of a car, suggesting he might be near a parked vehicle. The overall setting invokes a mix of rural tranquility and industrial activity, possibly hinting at environmental concerns or the outskirts of an industrial town.","title":"Resident of community adjacent to U.S. Steel plant.
