{"path":"557485.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene river landscape. In the foreground, the dark, slightly murky waters of the river are evident, with visible green algae or aquatic plant growth scattered throughout the water's surface, creating a textured appearance. The details of the water suggest it might be somewhat stagnant or slow-moving.\n\nIn the background, the opposite riverbank is visible. It features a line of buildings, predominantly white-washed, which appear to be residential homes or possibly small hotels. These buildings are built along the ridge of the hill, providing a picturesque view over the river. The hill is steep and seems to be partially covered with low vegetation, adding a lush green contrast to the primarily blue and white color palette of the scene.\n\nThe sky above is a clear blue, indicative of a bright, sunny day without much cloud cover. This clear sky complements the tranquil mood conveyed by the overall setting. The ambiance suggests a peaceful, somewhat secluded riverine environment, possibly in a suburban or semi-rural area.","title":"Buena vista lagoon, suffers from septic tank seePage, erosion and other ills.  It is an example of one of the last lagoons in southern California.  The body of water is an excellent bird refuge but is becoming surrounded by freeways and developments.  Coastal wetlands necessary to maintain wildlife totaled some 381,000 acres in 1900.  By the early 1970's that amount had decreased to about 125,000 acres","placename":"Oceanside (Calif.)","location":"Oceanside, California","nn1":["548096","550839","548868","549457","550656","555575","557106","542653","551067","554762","551536","553003","550367","552318","556964","551526"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","hotel","algae","hill","ridge","complement","growth","riverbank","build","home"]}
