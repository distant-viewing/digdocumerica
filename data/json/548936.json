{"path":"548936.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showcasing a large dam and its surrounding environment. The dam, which is prominently featured in the center of the image, is a massive curved structure straddling a deep gorge, holding back a large body of water on one side, creating a reservoir. The water in the reservoir appears a deep blue, contrasting with the arid, rugged terrain surrounding it.\n\nOn the left side of the dam, the terrain is characterized by sharp, craggy mountains that slope down to the water's edge. The right side shows similar terrain but includes more infrastructural elements such as roads. A two-lane road curves around the reservoir, trailing off into the mountainous landscape, hinting at connectivity to regions beyond the vicinity of the dam.\n\nThe dam itself is equipped with what appear to be gates and penstocks, possibly for hydroelectric power generation, and there are various buildings and facilities adjacent to it, likely associated with the dam's operations. The water downstream is considerably lower, suggesting the dam's role in water level control and resource management.\n\nThe overall setting is remote and rugged, indicating that the location is primarily utilized for its water resource management and possibly power generation capabilities. The photograph provides a panoramic view of the interaction between human engineering and natural landscape, with clear skies and bright sunlight accentuating the stark contrasts in color and texture between water, rock, and constructed elements.","title":"Parker Dam on the Colorado River","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548927","548975","548007","548920","548915","548013","548947","548003","548938","549004","549024","548012","544140","548942","548930","548024"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["dam","reservoir","generation","resource","water","management","gorge","power","capability","terrain"]}
