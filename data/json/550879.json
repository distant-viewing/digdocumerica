{"path":"550879.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic and vibrant scene of a boat racing event. There are three speedboats in motion, racing close to each other on a body of water, causing white water spray as they cut through the waves at high speeds. Each boat appears to contain at least one person steering or navigating.\n\nThe first boat in the foreground is painted red and displays the number \"FL-12\" prominently on its side. Slightly behind, the other two boats also showcase bold colors and numbers. Despite the speed and action, the focus and exposure are centered mostly on the front boat, making it a clear subject of the photo.\n\nIn the background, there is an industrial setting visible across the waterway. The landscape features large industrial buildings, including structures with stacks and roof vents, which suggests a manufacturing plant or a similar facility. The shoreline is fortified with what appears to be layered concrete or stone, possibly a retaining wall for erosion control or flood management.\n\nThe background gives a contrasting backdrop to the high-energy and recreational activity taking place in the foreground, highlighting a mix of industrial and recreational uses of waterfront areas. The sky is overcast, lending a muted light to the scene, which intensifies the vivid colors of the boats.","title":"Speedboat racing at Green Bay. In the background is the Fort Howard Paper Company.
