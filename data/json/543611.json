{"path":"543611.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil natural scene featuring a body of water, likely a pond or a small lake, reflecting the sky and surrounding forest. The image is taken during what appears to be early evening, with the light partially obscured, possibly by the time of day or cloud cover, giving the scene a somewhat muted and moody tone.\n\nIn the upper half of the image, the sky, filled with various types of clouds ranging from fluffy and white to denser and grey, dominates. These clouds are reflected in the water below, creating a mirror image effect that adds depth and a sense of serenity to the composition.\n\nThe tree line surrounding the water is dense and primarily composed of tall, slender trees, which could be conifers mixed with some deciduous trees lacking leaves. This suggests the photo might have been taken in late fall or early spring. The silhouette of the trees against the sky adds a dramatic touch to the overall atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe natural setting is devoid of human presence or any man-made structures, emphasizing a sense of isolation and untouched wilderness. The overall composition, with its reflections, interplay of light and shadow, and natural framing by the trees, portrays a peaceful yet somewhat somber landscape.\n","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["554776","546963","554527","554608","550493","554405","554616","554526","550777","552142","550389","554753","553410","557569","554623","545213"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["cloud","tree","conifer","serenity","mirror","half","framing","fall","pond","grey"]}
