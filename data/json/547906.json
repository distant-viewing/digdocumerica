{"path":"547906.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, scattered heap of debris and waste, comprising various discarded items such as wooden planks, metal poles, and broken furniture. The setting appears to be an open field under a gloomy, stormy sky, adding a dramatic tone to the scene. The field contains tall grass on the outskirts of the debris pile.\n\nThere are several people in the image, engaged in different activities. In the foreground, a person is seen throwing a slender object, possibly a stick or a piece of debris, while moving briskly. Another individual, standing nearer to the middle of the debris area, seems to be sifting or searching through the pile. A third person is seen in the background, watching or waiting. The interactions suggest they might be cleaning up or perhaps scavenging.\n\nIn the far background, the silhouette of a large bridge can be seen beneath the stormy sky, indicating that this location may be on the outskirts of an urban area. The overall composition creates a photographic narrative that touches on themes of waste disposal, environmental management, and perhaps a hint of resilience or recreation in the face of urban decay.","title":"Municipal incineration plant and landfill dump at Gravesend Bay serves as playground for neighborhood boys","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543165","549774","542549","543824","547983","545299","550246","549750","556640","554437","547868","547899","547901","542550","549957","549307"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["debris","outskirt","waste","pile","stick","disposal","heap","field","furniture","recreation"]}
