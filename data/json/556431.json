{"path":"556431.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene likely in a small town setting. It appears to be a sunny day, casting distinct shadows and brightening the colors in the image.\n\nForeground:\n- A group of individuals, possibly children and teenagers, are scattered across a large paved area which resembles a schoolyard or community playground.\n- Several people are standing, while others are sitting on a circular, low stone wall.\n- The activities vary: a group is engaged in conversation sitting on the wall; one individual is shooting a basketball towards a hoop attached to a pole; others are merely loitering and observing.\n\nMiddle ground:\n- A black car is parked on a quiet street that separates the playground from the residential buildings on the far side.\n\nBackground:\n- Prominently, there are two-story residential buildings with distinct red brick and black roofing. A porch is visible on one of the buildings, suggesting a typical neighborhood setup.\n- Adjacent to the main building, a faded Coca-Cola sign hangs, indicating either a small business or a community center.\n- The area is lush with greenery, including large trees that provide a serene backdrop to the urban setting.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- The overall atmosphere is casual and relaxed, highlighting a typical day in a community where people, particularly the youth, are engaging in spontaneous outdoor activities. The setting indicates a cohesive community vibe, focused around communal spaces and local business.","title":"Children during recess at the chattaroy, West Virginia school.  In the background is a former company store, now privately owned.  The town has no industry and most people are supported by welfare, pensions, social security and black lung benefits.  A few people drive into Williamson nearby to work.  It is a nice small town the children often walk home from school for lunch and even to use the bathroom while out for recess","placename":"Williamson (W.
