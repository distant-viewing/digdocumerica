{"path":"556877.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph presents a scene on a railway track during what appears to be maintenance or construction work. The photo is taken from a perspective looking down the tracks, capturing the linear layout of the railway.\n\nIn the foreground, we can see a detailed view of the railway tracks themselves, accompanied by various railroad ties and construction equipment. Several workers in safety gear, including helmets, are spread out along the tracks. The worker closest to the camera is walking on one of the rails, heading towards the camera.\n\nFurther down the tracks, there's a larger piece of machinery, likely used for the railway's maintenance. This machine is generating a significant amount of dust or steam, contributing to the misty and industrial atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe surrounding area is somewhat overgrown, with bushes and trees indicating a less urban environment. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the entire scene, which emphasizes the muted tones of the workers' attire and the natural environment.\n\nOverall, the composition is focused on the linear perspective provided by the railway tracks, leading the viewerâ€™s eye through the photograph, from the detailed machinery and workers in the foreground to the misty background. This effectively conveys a sense of depth and ongoing activity in the scene.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew, exchanging old track for new quarter mile long sections of rail. On a good day when the crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded tracks per day. In 1974 Southern had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of railroad track.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556873","556902","556869","556856","556871","556878","556889","556859","556888","556883","556901","556870","556874","556895","556879","556885"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["railway","track","worker","maintenance","machinery","construction","perspective","railroad","camera","tie"]}
