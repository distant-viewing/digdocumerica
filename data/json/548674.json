{"path":"548674.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene primarily focused on a large, aged billboard against a dramatic sky. The billboard has the text \"Welcome to SUNSHINE KEY\" prominently displayed in green and white lettering. Below the text, part of a map is visible with the silhouette of what appears to be a peninsula or island chain, and a sun motif present near the center of the map.\n\nThe sky above and behind the billboard is dynamic and filled with an array of clouds. The sun is partially visible and casts a soft glow, with sunbeams faintly radiating through the cloud coverâ€”suggesting either an early morning or late afternoon setting. There are thick, darker clouds alongside more wispy ones, contributing to an overall expansive and slightly moody atmosphere that contrasts with the welcoming message of the billboard.\n\nThe angle of the photograph is such that the billboard stretches up from the lower edge of the frame right up to the middle, converging with the powerful elements of the sky above, symbolizing perhaps a gateway to the area advertised as sunshine-filled, despite the foreboding clouds. The colors are rich, with the deeper hues of blue in the sky and the slightly faded but still vibrant colors of the billboard dominating the visual composition.","title":"Entrance to travel-trailer camp at Ohio, or \"sunshine key\" extensive dredging, filling and defoliation have taken place to make way for the camp.
