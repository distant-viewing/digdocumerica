{"path":"554077.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a lush, verdant coastal landscape. It presents a series of carefully cultivated taro fields in the foreground, organized into several rectangular plots, each filled with vibrant green vegetation. The fields are divided by small narrow paths, allowing access for cultivation and maintenance.\n\nBeyond the fields, the landscape opens up to a sandy shoreline bordered by tall, slender palm trees swaying gently, suggesting a breezy environment. The coast curves subtly, enclosing a serene bay where small waves can be seen breaking near the shore.\n\nIn the middle distance, a small cluster of traditional huts with thatched roofs is nestled among the dense tropical foliage, indicative of a small rural community. This settlement appears to integrate seamlessly with the natural environment, emphasizing a sustainable, traditional way of life.\n\nThe background is dominated by steep, rocky headlands that drop sharply into the sea, framing the bay and adding a dramatic touch to the serene scene. These cliffs are covered with dense greenery, enhancing the untouched, pristine nature of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its rich greens and the peaceful ocean view, creates a tranquil and picturesque scene, showcasing the beauty of agricultural practices in harmony with nature along a tropical coastline.","title":"Taro patches along highway 36.
