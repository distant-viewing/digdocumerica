{"path":"554697.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a peaceful, pastoral scene centered around a traditional American-style house. The house is predominantly white with a grey shingled roof. The architecture features quaint details like decorative trim and multi-pane windows outfitted with short curtains.\n\nIn the foreground, the house sports a wide, covered porch that spans the entire visible length of the building. The porch is supported by ornate white columns, adding to the homey and rustic ambiance. Two rocking chairs and one other traditional chair are arranged invitingly on the porch, suggesting a relaxed lifestyle and a place for leisurely afternoons.\n\nThe background of the image reveals a large, open grassy area, gently sloping and dotted sporadically with trees that hint at a rural or semi-rural setting. The absence of fences or other houses suggests the property enjoys a measure of solitude and open space.\n\nThe atmosphere is quiet and serene, evoking a sense of tranquility and a slower pace of life, idealized in rural American settings. The image, taken during the day, has diffuse lighting likely from an overcast sky, softening shadows and colors. Overall, this photograph conveys a snapshot of rural American life, inviting reflection and appreciation of a simpler, peaceful environment.","title":"Empty rocking chairs on an old farmhouse porch on route 73","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["550704","548295","556959","557746","557094","557669","546441","550124","558110","557326","542801","545041","554767","558153","548664","549279"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["porch","house","chair","homey","shingle","appreciation","pace","measure","slop","lifestyle"]}
