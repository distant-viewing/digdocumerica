{"path":"550699.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a sign mounted on a metal post. The sign has a white background with black lettering and reads \"DO NOT PEEL BARK FROM TREES\" in capital letters. In the top-left corner of the sign, there is a black triangle containing the letters \"NH,\" indicating that this sign may be in or related to New Hampshire. The sign shows signs of wear and exposure to elements, as evidenced by chipped paint and rust around the bolt holes.\n\nThe background of the image is composed of lush greenery, suggesting that the sign is located in a park or a wooded area. There appear to be several trees in varying depths in the background, with leaves that are well-illuminated by sunlight, creating dappled light effects. This setting implies the sign's purpose is to protect the natural environment by prohibiting the removal of bark from trees, likely to preserve the health and aesthetics of the area. The daytime setting and natural lighting accentuate the verdant environment surrounding the sign.","title":"Sign at the \"Shelburne Birches\" area on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["547854","548846","552084","550664","554103","542789","547123","554038","548159","546386","544177","545617","547850","548845","544845","544913"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["sign","letter","removal","bolt","capital","hole","health","lettering","bark","daytime"]}
