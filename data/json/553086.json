{"path":"553086.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil natural scene featuring a large expanse of water reflecting the sky, surrounded by varying types of vegetation and landscape. The water, possibly a lake or wetland, fills the central part of the image, and it appears calm with a reflective surface.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is dense, lush green grass which indicates the presence of a wetland or marshy area. This greenery runs along the edge of the water and is interspersed with patches of muddy ground. A telephone pole is positioned awkwardly in the middle of the scene, crossing from the left-hand side, and it adds a human-made element to the otherwise natural landscape. This pole carries several wires that cut horizontally across the frame.\n\nOn the right, the landscape includes sparse sandy or rocky ground with low vegetation and small shrubs extending towards the horizon. A series of hills or low mountains can be faintly seen in the background under a hazy sky. These features suggest a semi-arid region. No distinct activity is occurring in the scene; however, a small bird can be observed flying above the wetland which adds life to the tranquil scene. \n\nOverall, the composition highlights the contrast between natural environments and the intrusion of human infrastructure, depicted through the presence of the telephone pole and wires against the untamed natural backdrop.","title":"Water standing in flooded fields near Fallon -- a result of over-irrigating and poor farming","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["545008","546109","544765","547488","555570","550750","544695","548030","557498","543611","554527","550345","550778","555637","546963","550753"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","telephone","pole","wire","intrusion","fly","occur","bird","presence","cross"]}
