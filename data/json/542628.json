{"path":"542628.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene pastoral landscape. The setting is a lush green field dotted with numerous trees that appear to be oaks judging by their size and the density of their leafy branches. Light filters through the leaves, creating patterns of shadow and light on the grass below. In the field, there are several cows grazing quietly. The cows are dark in color and mainly concentrated towards the left side of the image, adding a sense of life and rural activity. The background shows an expansive field that extends far into the distance, bordered by additional trees that form a natural boundary. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and bucolic, capturing a classic rural scene with a focus on nature and tranquility.","title":"Black angus cattle at ranch","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["542627","542626","550833","552566","554560","554071","557012","545153","546102","555645","557749","551305","557439","542960","557022","542652"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["cow","field","oak","graze","concentrate","judge","density","boundary","filter","dot"]}
