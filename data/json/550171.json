{"path":"550171.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling industrial scene, underscored by environmental pollution and the bustle of urban life. The foreground shows a line of cars, predominantly a prominent black car nearest to the viewer, on a busy road, perhaps during morning or evening rush hour due to the lighting. The cars all appear to be from the mid-20th century, suggesting the age of the photograph.\n\nThe central and background parts of the image are densely packed with various elements of industrial infrastructure. Numerous electricity and utility poles, lined up in parallel rows, dominate the middle ground. They extend into the distance, converging towards a central focal point, creating a strong perspective.\n\nIn addition, several large industrial structures with visible chimneys are emitting thick white and dark smoke, contributing to the haze that slightly obscures the scene. This indicates heavy industrial activity, possibly involving factories or power plants. The sky is a murky blend of oranges and yellows, possibly due to the time of day being either dawn or dusk, or potentially exacerbated by air pollution from the smoke.\n\nOverall, the image provides a stark representation of industrial impact on the environment, depicting a scene rich in detail about mid-century industrial life and the accompanying vehicular and atmospheric pollution.","title":"Clark avenue and clark avenue bridge, looking east from west 13th street, are obscured by smoke from heavy industry","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550175","551057","550191","550179","550173","548326","551033","557224","546074","545443","545507","545463","546212","550183","545455","551069"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["pollution","yellows","car","rush","smoke","electricity","bustle","addition","orang","converge"]}
