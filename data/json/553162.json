{"path":"553162.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph shows an elevated view of a public square or plaza, likely taken from a balcony or upper window. The composition of the image is striking, with strong geometric patterns forming much of the visual interest. The plaza's floor is tiled in a pattern of larger light-colored squares bordered by dark bricks, creating a grid-like effect. Within this grid, there are several large, dark shadows cast by tall lampposts visible at the bottom edge of the frame.\n\nIn the plaza, various people are seen engaging in different activities. There are individuals walking across the square, each following the paved pathways. A few groups are gathered at the far end of the plaza, where some benches are located under the shade of trees. The plaza appears to be a busy, urban environment with people in movement, either crossing the square or socializing in the shaded areas.\n\nThe lighting is bright, indicating it is a sunny day, which contributes to the sharp, clearly defined shadows of the lampposts. The overall ambience is of a lively public space, likely a central area in a city where people come to transit, meet, or relax.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: light stanchions in afternoon sun","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["550003","550759","553324","549999","549988","551795","557267","550755","551797","551792","551800","553320","553317","550751","551823","551651"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["plaza","square","lamppost","grid","socialize","people","tile","ambience","relax","transit"]}
