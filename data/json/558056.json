{"path":"558056.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This is an aerial photograph capturing an expansive outdoor scene, dominated by lush greenery and architectural structures, likely part of a park or a similar recreational area. Several key elements and their composition are noted below:\n\n1. **Main Building**: Prominently in the upper right quadrant, there is a large building with a very distinctive, large, sloping roof, almost resembling a tent or a swooping triangle. This roof is dark in color, contrasting sharply with the green surrounding it. The structure is surrounded by trees with their leaves beginning to show autumnal colors, hinting at the season being either early fall or late summer.\n\n2. **Parking Lots**: There are multiple parking areas visible in the image. Two large, segmented parking lots lie in the foreground toward the bottom. They are well-organized, with clearly marked parking spaces. Smaller parking areas are scattered around the main building, suggesting that this is a place that accommodates a significant number of visitors.\n\n3. **Vegetation and Landscaping**: The area is heavily wooded, with patches of dense trees surrounding and interspersing the developed areas. This creates a serene, natural setting. The trees show a mix of green and beginning-to-turn leaves, providing a colorful contrast to the mostly man-made structures and paved areas.\n\n4. **Roads and Paths**: Curving paths and roads weave through the scene, connecting the different areas smoothly and unobtrusively. A winding road can be seen leading from the bottom of the image up toward the main building, implying a gentle, scenic approach to the structure.\n\n5. **Miscellaneous Structures**: Aside from the main building, there are smaller structures and possibly service buildings near it. Their smaller size and simpler roofs suggest functional, less focal roles compared to the large central building.\n\n6. **Background and Environment**: The entire scene is set in a secluded area that seems relatively untouched by urban development, beyond the structures and modifications visible. This suggests a focus on preservation of natural beauty and possibly an emphasis on outdoor activities or events.\n\nThis photograph seems to capture a well-maintained facility, possibly intended for public gatherings, performances, or as a park center, designed to integrate closely with its natural environment. The exact function of the large central building remains unclear, but its prominent architectural design suggests it serves as a central hub for activities or as a landmark within the area.","title":"Aerial view of the Blossom Music Center, summer home of the Cleveland, Ohio, Symphony. It is located near Northampton, within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area north of Akron. The recreation area contains 30,000 acres of largely undeveloped land located in a 20-mile stretch of the valley between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron. The law authorizes $34.5 million for land expenditure, but the money must be appropriated by Congress.","placename":"North Hampton (Ohio)","location":"North Hampton, Ohio","nn1":["551613","546702","544503","542593","550547","546464","546473","546624","557750","543580","558047","548022","553899","546460","546468","544560"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["parking","building","roof","bottom","structure","beginning","area","quadrant","modification","preservation"]}
