{"path":"556580.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph presents a serene village scene nestled within a verdant mountain valley. The focus is on a small community with houses that are primarily one to two stories high and appear to be detached, standalone structures. These homes showcase a range of architectural styles and colors, but largely feature side gable roofs and horizontal siding. Most of the houses are surrounded by well-kept front yards, some of which have small gardens or neatly mowed lawns.\n\nThe environment around the community is lush, with thick forested hills cloaking the background, emphasizing a feeling of seclusion and closeness to nature. The foliage-heavy hills suggest a location in a temperate climate zone where rainfall is likely plentiful.\n\nA paved road bisects the foreground, accompanied by utility poles and wires, indicating access to modern amenities. There are also visible pathways that connect the properties to each other, enhancing the community feel of the area. Additionally, there are a few scattered vehicles, suggesting the time period might be from the mid-20th century onwards when personal transportation became more common in rural settings.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph depicts a peaceful, rural lifestyle, with homes spaced comfortably apart amidst a natural setting that is both inviting and secluded. The elements in this image collectively portray a quiet, settled community life integrated with its natural surroundings.","title":"Small country town not related to coal mining near the West Virginia turnpike north of Beckley.
