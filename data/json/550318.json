{"path":"550318.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph depicts a coastal town viewed across a body of water, possibly a harbor. The town is scattered with various buildings that range in architectural style, suggesting a mix of historical and more contemporary influences. The buildings closest to the waterfront are dense, with some structures appearing to be warehouses or industrial facilities due to their proximity to the water and their utilitarian design.\n\nTowards the back of the town, residential or possibly small commercial buildings become more prevalent. These are interspersed with significant amounts of greenery, indicating gardens or small parks within the town. The structures vary in color, but many have muted tones that blend with the overcast sky.\n\nDominating the town's skyline are several steeples and spires, indicating the presence of churches or other significant buildings. These taller structures add a historical and possibly religious significance to the town's character. \n\nIn the background, beyond the town, there is a rise of land that suggests the town is in a valley or protected bay area. The sky is overcast, giving the scene a muted, soft lighting that enhances the quaint, serene feeling of the setting. \n\nOverall, the composition and elements within the photograph suggest a quiet, coastal town rich in history and possibly geared towards maritime activities, nestled in a naturally protected geographical area.","title":"Town of Eastport as seen from Campobello Island","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["542913","549362","550322","542878","549377","550314","550307","550363","542907","542910","554102","543423","555688","547984","556979","550271"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["town","steeple","spire","influence","harbor","building","history","significance","church","bay"]}
