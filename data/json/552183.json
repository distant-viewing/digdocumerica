{"path":"552183.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This image offers an aerial view captured from a high altitude, looking down on an expansive landscape shrouded in fog. The photograph shows several key elements:\n\n1. **Fog Coverage**: The most prominent feature is the thick bank of fog that partially covers the area, creating a mystic and serene atmosphere. The fog is uneven, with some areas completely hidden while others peek through slightly.\n\n2. **River and Industrial Areas**: Toward the bottom of the picture, a river can be seen alongside what appears to be industrial zones. There are several large buildings, possibly factories or warehouses, and a complex network of roads.\n\n3. **Vegetation and Open Fields**: On the left side of the image, there are open fields and patches of greenery, indicating some form of agricultural or undeveloped land.\n\n4. **Residential and Urban Areas**: Through the fog, the layout of a town or city is partially visible, with dense arrangements of buildings suggesting residential or urban areas. The structures vary in size and are quite compact.\n\n5. **Lighting and Time of Day**: The lighting suggests either early morning or late evening, with soft light diffusing through the fog, enhancing the tranquil and somewhat eerie feel of the landscape.\n\n6. **Color Palette**: The overall color palette consists of muted earth tones, greens, and grays, with the fog adding a layer of soft white and gray over the scene.\n\n7. **Overall Composition**: The composition is dynamic yet harmonious, with natural elements like fog and the river contrasting against the man-made structures and roads. The aerial perspective provides a comprehensive view that captures both the vastness and the detailed intricacies of the landscape.","title":"Smoke from Tacoma's industrial waterfront drifts over the city.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553649","545042","550705","542998","545012","556965","550589","550864","550555","549116","554647","555536","550544","552171","550638","556907"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["fog","intricacy","hide","peek","shroud","river","warehouse","altitude","road","network"]}
