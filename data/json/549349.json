{"path":"549349.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph shows a male scientist working inside a laboratory full of various glassware that captures focus with their clarity and detail in the foreground. The scientist appears to be middle-aged, wearing glasses and is concentrating on heating a substance in a test tube over a Bunsen burner flame. He is holding the test tube with one hand and manipulating the flame with another using a lighter or a similar tool.\n\nThe glass apparatuses are slightly blurry and include numerous test tubes, flasks, and possibly pipettes, creating a chaotic yet intriguing pattern of scientific equipment. The background is subdued with light blue tones, providing contrast to the colorful flame and the reflective surfaces of the glassware.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its foreground focus on the glassware and the scientist actively engaged in an experiment, conveys a sense of scientific discovery and intense focus. The ambient lighting and the vivid colors captured in the photo enhance the sense of depth and texture within the laboratory environment.","title":"Anton perija, chief glassblower for the many scientific instruments used at the ruder boskovic institute.
