{"path":"542920.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts an older model car parked under a shelter that appears to be a garage or carport. The structure has a classic design, white-painted wooden siding, and a large sign mounted on the wall above the car which reads \"ELK GARAGE ESTAB. 1901 M.R. MATSON, PROP.\" The typeface of the sign has an old-fashioned, decorative style, indicating the long history of the establishment.\n\nThe car itself has an elegant, vintage design featuring a prominent grill and rounded headlights. It is a convertible model, and the roof is down, exposing the interior of the car. The license plate of the car visible in the photograph reads \"LSE 823.\"\n\nThe setting seems to be dusk or in low-light conditions, contributing to the moody atmosphere of the scene. The garage is illuminated from above by artificial lighting, casting shadows and highlighting the texture of the wooden siding as well as the glossy finish of the carâ€™s body. The environment surrounding the car carries a sense of nostalgic charm, reflective of the early mid-20th century era.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554933","557847","546230","555922","550683","557878","557900","552995","544641","557848","554920","557685","557905","556713","557692","550152"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["garage","car","siding","model","grill","read","license","finish","headlight","shelter"]}
