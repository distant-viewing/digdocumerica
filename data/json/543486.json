{"path":"543486.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a group of Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts gathered at an outdoor event, likely during a parade or a scouting assembly. The image is filled with young boys dressed in traditional scouting uniforms; the Cub Scouts wear dark blue uniforms adorned with yellow neckerchiefs and various patches, while the older Boy Scouts have tan-green uniforms with olive green shoulder loops and patches indicating their troop number and rank.\n\nMany of the boys are paying attention, perhaps listening or watching something out of the frame, indicating they are participating in an organized event. Various expressions on their faces range from attentive to curious, while some are slightly distracted. The scene is set on a sunny day, casting natural light that highlights their facial features and scouting insignia.\n\nIn the background, there are adults mixed in with the children; some might be parents or troop leaders dressed in casual clothing, observing the event and supervising the Scouts. A large, colorful tarp or tent structure, in soft tones of orange and hints of white, marks the event setting in the background, suggesting an occasional or festive environment.\n\nOverall, the composition reflects a typical scouting activity filled with engagement, learning, and community involvement, underlined by an organized and structured assembly.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["554450","543229","543176","543228","543482","543162","543230","544829","556284","549571","543177","556437","549320","552589","544802","543234"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["event","uniform","assembly","boy","parent","insignia","loop","tarp","learning","tent"]}
