{"path":"550317.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene focused on a man engaging in fly fishing in a river. The man is standing in the center of the image, partway in the water. He is dressed practically for fishing, wearing waterproof waders extending to his chest, a long-sleeved shirt, and a cap. He appears to be middle-aged or older and is holding a fishing rod with his right hand, actively casting the line.\n\nThe river looks moderately shallow and calm where the man is standing but shows more turbulent water in the background, indicating the presence of a rapid or possibly a small waterfall. Surrounding the river are lush, verdant bushes and trees, hinting at a natural, possibly secluded or rural location.\n\nIn the background to the right, a constructed dam or weir is visible with water cascading through its multiple gates, creating a foamy and dynamic water surface. The structure seems to be made of wooden beams and is quite substantial in size. There's a gravel path leading down to the water on the far right, enhancing the accessibility for activities like fishing. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cool or temperate climate.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a tranquil but engaging outdoor fishing activity, set against a backdrop of natural beauty and man-made structure. It evokes a sense of peaceful coexistence with nature.","title":"Fly fisherman at Big Falls, GRand Lake Stream, a famous salmon stream and part of the east branch of the St. Croix River.
