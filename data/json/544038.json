{"path":"544038.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a high-speed scene involving a large dune buggy kicking up a massive cloud of dust in an arid, possibly desert-like environment. The dune buggy is centralized in the frame, racing from left to right, and is only partially visible due to the enormous amount of sand and dust swirling behind and around it.\n\nIn detail, the dune buggy appears to be a rugged, stripped-down vehicle, primarily consisting of a skeletal frame and off-road tires, designed specifically for sandy or uneven terrains. The vehicle is equipped with a rear-mounted engine, evident from its positioning and the direction of the dust trail. It has seats that accommodate at least two people, both of whom are wearing protective gear, likely including helmets.\n\nThe setting is characterized by a flat, expansive surface, which seems to be a dry lakebed or desert plain, coated with a thin layer of sand or fine dust. The background has sparse vegetation, typical of a desert, including small bushes and a few distant cacti, suggesting a very dry climate. The sky is slightly overexposed, indicating a sunny day with harsh lighting conditions.\n\nThe action captured and the composition of the image, with a focus on movement and speed, conveys a sense of adventure and adrenaline, typical of off-road buggy racing in desert environments. The vast cloud of dust emphasizes the speed and dynamic nature of the activity.","title":"Sand buggy churns the desert terrain of MaRicopa County.","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["553056","548986","545098","543370","545102","543207","543211","543208","545596","553058","545094","545604","545071","544869","544428","551969"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["dust","dune","desert","speed","sand","racing","positioning","engine","cloud","seat"]}
