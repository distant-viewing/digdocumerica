{"path":"547724.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial or satellite view, featuring a striking and vibrant landscape. The image is dominated by a patchwork of large, rectangular fields that vary in hues of deep reds, browns, and muted oranges. These fields are meticulously organized, suggesting a highly developed agricultural area.\n\nTowards the bottom of the image, contrasting sharply with the orderly farmland, there is a vivid, natural feature. A serpentine river or estuary system appears in bright red tones, branching out intricately like veins. This river system is surrounded by darker areas, likely bodies of water, which help highlight its complex, spreading pattern. The choice of colors and resolution details in this photograph gives it an almost abstract quality, emphasizing shapes and patterns over specific details.\n\nThe upper portion of the photograph also features a rugged, irregularly shaped mass, possibly a rocky outcrop or a small mountainous area, surrounded by darker tones that could be water bodies.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its sharp contrasts between the orderly human-made agricultural grids and the organic, meandering forms of the natural waterways, creates a visually compelling image that also suggests a narrative about human interaction with the natural environment.","title":"Farmland of the imperial valley, and the salton sea infrared film","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["547725","553661","542708","542730","547995","553668","542517","553972","553973","548817","544768","550392","549094","542713","549081","552858"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["system","vein","mass","patchwork","farmland","choice","shape","outcrop","field","river"]}
