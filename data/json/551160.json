{"path":"551160.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a lively, natural scene featuring a group of children enjoying water activities in a large body of water, possibly a river or lake. On the right-hand side of the image, there is a concrete structure that juts into the water, which two of the children are using for their aquatic games. One child, noticeably younger, wearing blue swimwear, stands on the concrete platform, reaching towards a vertical wooden post, perhaps in a playful attempt to climb or interact with it. Another child, with long, dark hair and wearing a bikini, is swimming in the water near the platform, her face visible above the waterline, turning slightly towards the other child on the platform.\n\nOn the left, there is a third child, also submerged in the water, whose face is less visible, giving the impression of swimming or floating. The background features a wooded hill that further emphasizes the natural setting, with dense trees running along the curve of the water's edge, enhancing the feeling of a secluded, peaceful spot ideal for recreational swimming.\n\nOverall, the composition with vibrant natural light and lively children engaging with natural elements creates a sense of summertime joy and freedom.","title":"Down the kanawha river from Charleston on route 62, boys swim and dive from piers of an old coal-loading operation","placename":"Charleston (W.
