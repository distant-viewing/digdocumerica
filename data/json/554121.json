{"path":"554121.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene at a beach. In the center of the image, there is a person standing at the edge of the shore, where the ocean waves gently lap against the sandy beach. The individual appears to be a woman wearing a light-colored sun hat and a patterned swimsuit, standing in profile as she gazes out over the sea. The surroundings are serene with dark, volcanic sand comprising the beach and a closely set clump of tall, slender, shadowy trees lining the background just beyond the beach. These trees provide a dark contrast to the bright sky, which is not directly visible but illuminates the scene with a soft, diffuse light. The ocean water appears calm, with small waves breaking near the shore, creating a rhythmic and soothing ambiance. The overall mood is peaceful and contemplative, evoking a sense of solitude and connection with nature.","title":"Famous black sand beach at kaimu, created by lava runoff, is a favorite tourist stop.
