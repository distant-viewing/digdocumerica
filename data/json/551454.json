{"path":"551454.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a tender moment between an elderly couple seated on a ledge in what appears to be a busy outdoor city area. The man is wearing a dark suit, light pink shirt, a dark tie, and a derby hat. He holds the woman's hand, who is dressed in a green coat and green pants. Both sport glasses and seem to be in mid-conversation or deep in thought, enjoying each otherâ€™s company.\n\nAdjacent to them, slightly out of focus in the background, a young woman sits with her back turned to the camera. She wears a white short-sleeve top and blue jeans, and is apparently reading or looking at a small pink booklet. This creates a generational contrast between the activities and engagements of the young and the old.\n\nThe background features a blurred indoors setting visible through large panes of glass, suggesting a commercial building, possibly a store or office building. The area they are seated in is shaded from direct sunlight, emphasized by the reflections and light contrast in the glass facade of the background building. The area around the couple's seating place has some litter, showing perhaps a less meticulously maintained or frequented path of the city.\n\nThe overall atmosphere evokes a reflective, serene urban scene where life continues amidst a bustling environment. The composition subtly emphasizes the closeness and comfort the couple appears to draw from each other in a large city setting.","title":"Reading and resting on Nicollet Mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553202","543469","548614","553558","551450","549324","547834","558314","552931","557149","549673","547421","557143","551462","557713","554192"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["couple","glass","city","indoor","closeness","comfort","pane","ledge","seating","litter"]}
