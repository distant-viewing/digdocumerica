{"path":"547457.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph features a sailing yacht in action on choppy waters. The yacht, oriented at an angle to the viewer, is moving at a significant speed as evidenced by the water splashing against its bow. The deck of the yacht is populated with several individuals engaged in various sailing activities, all dressed appropriately in sailing gear, which generally includes windbreakers.\n\nThe yacht is a classic design with a sleek, dark-hull and a wooden deck. Its large, white sail is fully hoisted and catching wind, indicating that it's a breezy day. The rigging and mast structure are visible, with ropes and other sailing equipment evident. The crew appears busy, likely adjusting sails or handling navigation tasks, demonstrating teamwork and coordination.\n\nIn the background, to the left of the yacht, another sailboat can be seen at a distance, sailing parallel but further away. The sky is overcast, suggesting it might be either early morning or late afternoon, giving a slightly dull, muted light to the scene, emphasizing the sense of active adventure amidst natural elements.\n\nThis dynamic depiction captures the essence of sailing, focusing on the interaction between the sailors, their boat, and the environment.","title":"A contender southbound toward the open ocean in the Annapolis--Newport Race, a multi-class biennial sailing event.
