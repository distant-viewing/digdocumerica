{"path":"544085.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph depicts a group of people engaged in activities on a rugged outdoor site, possibly during an excavation or geological survey, suggested by the helmets and equipment some of them are wearing. In the foreground, a woman in a pink shirt and white trousers, wearing sunglasses and holding a camera, walks past while looking down, seemingly disengaged from the main activity. Near her, a man kneels on the ground, meticulously using a hammer on the rocks, focused on his task.\n\nThe majority of the group is visible in the background, spanning out across the rocky terrain which is littered with large and small stones. Most of the individuals are wearing protective helmets, suggesting safety precautions for the environment they are in. The setting is arid with a clear, bright-blue sky and no vegetation in sight, emphasizing the starkness and possibly harsh conditions of the location.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of scientific or explorative activity, highlighted by the contrast between the focused group and the seemingly aloof woman passing by. The harsh lighting and shadows suggest the intensity of the sun, reinforcing the challenging conditions of the environment.","title":"Tourists look for souvenirs among waste rock at the anaconda co.'
