{"path":"549240.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a scene from a large, open-pit mining operation. Prominently, there is a rugged landscape filled with mounds of earth featuring multiple shades of gray, black, and brown, and stretches of dirt tracks winding through the mining area. A yellow bulldozer, the main focus of the image, can be seen working near the foreground, suggesting active excavation or landscaping.\n\nThe pit is surrounded by small hills, some barren and others partially covered with sparse greenery. The top of the image features a more vegetated horizon with rolling hills and occasional trees, providing a stark contrast to the excavation area. The environment suggests arid or semi-arid conditions, likely impacting local ecology due to the mining activities. The lighting conditions, with bright sunlight and clear skies, emphasize the rugged textural details of the mining site and the surrounding landscape.","title":"Acme coal mine","placename":"Sheridan (Mont.)","location":"Sheridan, Montana","nn1":["549172","552177","549241","544112","554631","549242","553049","544110","544100","549177","555621","544107","544054","549171","544785","549167"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["mining","pit","excavation","landscaping","bulldozer","stretch","hill","condition","mound","track"]}
