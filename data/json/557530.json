{"path":"557530.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph displays a varied landscape, characterized by natural and urban elements. In the foreground, a large expanse of dry, golden grassland sets an expansive, somewhat wild tone to the scene. Central to this field, a lone figure walks among the tall grass, presenting a human element against the rugged backdrop.\n\nMiddle ground focuses on a row of modest, single-story houses. There are around six visible homes, exhibiting standard residential architecture with flat roofs and unremarkable exteriors, potentially indicative of a suburban or semi-rural community. The houses are a mix of darker and lighter tones, blending with the landscape yet distinctly separate.\n\nIn the background, a mountain looms large. It casts a formidable presence over the landscape with its gently rolling peaks and dark green hues, hinting at a relatively forested region, possibly signifying the edge of a suburban area approaching a more natural township boundary.\n\nThe overall composition juxtaposes the intervened human elements with the natural environment, underscoring themes of habitation, adaptation, and possibly the encroachment of urban development into natural landscapes. The image balances the populated areas with open natural spaces, suggesting a narrative about the relationship between humans and their environment.","title":"Houses near the pacific ocean north of Malibu, California, on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["553938","553130","544519","553059","543106","557726","557438","544523","553994","548060","544816","549034","557440","557516","552603","549156"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["encroachment","adaptation","relationship","grassland","house","loom","signify","approach","landscape","habitation"]}
