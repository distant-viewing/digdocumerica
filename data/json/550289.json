{"path":"550289.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic sunset scene with a city skyline silhouetted against a fiery red sky. The landscape is dominated by dark outlines of urban structures, including tall buildings and smokestacks, some of which are emitting smoke. The skyline is backlit by the sun, which is just visible at the horizon line, contributing to the vibrant shades of red and orange that fill the sky. There are also a couple of small clouds above the city that are highlighted by the sun's glow. The view appears to be taken from a distance across a body of water, as suggested by a smooth expanse in the foreground that reflects some of the skyâ€™s color. The overall mood of the image is moody and somewhat industrial due to the presence of the factories and the pollution they emit, contrasted with the natural beauty of the sunset.","title":"Dawn's early light struggles through the smog over Cleveland","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551956","548123","544082","556188","552264","543965","544086","545438","545425","545418","544708","545430","545414","543969","548851","545421"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["emit","sunset","skyline","fiery","sun","backlit","city","clouds","silhouet","couple"]}
