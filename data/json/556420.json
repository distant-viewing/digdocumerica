{"path":"556420.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a small town street scene, showcasing a blend of residential and commercial architecture typical of a rural American setting. Prominently visible in the center of the image is a large, three-story brick building with signage identifying it as a hotel. Its architectural style includes multiple windows, a flat roof, and external fire escapes prominent on its sides.\n\nAlong the street, there are various single-story homes with different sidings, including stone and horizontal panels. Front porches are a common feature, adding to the homely, communal vibe of the neighborhood.\n\nTo the right of the hotel, smaller commercial buildings can be seen, including what appears to be a shop with signs advertising 7 Up, Marlboro, and Pepsi. There's also a white sign for a car care center indicating the presence of everyday services within walking distance for residents.\n\nThe foreground shows a main road, curving slightly as it recedes into the distance, lined with parked cars indicating the presence of residents or visitors. Street signs are visible, including one that reads \"CLOTHIER UNINCORPORATED\" and another indicating entry into Logan County. These signs suggest that the town is Clothier, located in Logan County.\n\nThe background of the photo is filled with lush green hills, typical of a verdant, mountainous landscape, adding a serene backdrop to the otherwise quiet town scene. The overall composition of the image with its rustic buildings and verdant environment sets a scene of an American small town in a mountainous or rural setting.","title":"View of the main highway which runs through the unincorporated town of Clothier, West Virginia, near Madison in Logan County. It is an old mining town that boomed during World War II and the 1950's, then slowed down. Mining is coming back now that there is renewed interest in coal since the energy crisis.","placename":"Logan County (W.
