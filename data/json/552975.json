{"path":"552975.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures a leisurely family moment by a tranquil body of water, likely a river or a lake. In this serene, sunlit setting, three individuals are seen on a sandy shore amidst natural surroundings. On the left, a man with a beard and mustache, donned in red swimming shorts and black wading boots, is engaging playfully with a small child. He appears to be either catching the child or tossing her in the air, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The child wears a light-colored one-piece outfit suitable for swimming.\n\nTo the right, a woman is standing and watching the interaction with calm attention. She wears a floral swim dress and is barefoot, suggesting a relaxed outing by the water. Her hair is styled in a long, straight manner, complementing her gentle demeanor.\n\nThe background features lush greenery and some large boulders partially submerged in water, providing a scenic natural landscape. The water reflects the foliage and sunlight, enhancing the aura of a calm, isolated retreat. Further hints of scattered vegetation that include bright foliage suggest an early autumn season. In the distance, a canoe is subtly visible, nestled against a dark, tree-lined bank, hinting at further recreational activity.","title":"(from the Documerica-1 exhibition.
