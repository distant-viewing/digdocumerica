{"path":"546974.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene set against a natural wetland environment. In the foreground, there is a calm body of water reflecting the sky and some of the surrounding plant life. Surrounding the water are patches of marshy vegetation, predominantly composed of reeds and grasses, with some areas appearing muddy and waterlogged.\n\nThe background contrasts sharply with the natural forefront. It features an industrial complex with various large structures, including buildings, towers, and smokestacks. Some of these structures are tall and vertical, with a prominent central tower that stands out due to its height and layered sections. Smoke or steam can be seen emitting from one of the stacks, suggesting ongoing industrial activity.\n\nScattered throughout the industrial background are cranes, likely used for construction or logistic purposes within the facility. The sky above is overcast, casting a muted light over the entire scene, which complements the industrial backdrop's stark, utilitarian feel.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the intersection of nature and industry, highlighting the contrast between the serene, natural wetland and the busy, mechanical aspects of the industrial complex.","title":"The marsh in front of the Brunswick Pulp and Paper Company has been desTroyed by the plant's mercury waste.","placename":"Brunswick (Ga.)","location":"Brunswick, Georgia","nn1":["546978","550995","545996","544289","545989","557377","546118","550694","554630","546395","543813","546073","552194","545993","545862","557225"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["wetland","complex","tower","reed","intersection","stack","steam","forefront","smokestack","height"]}
