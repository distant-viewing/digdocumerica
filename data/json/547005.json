{"path":"547005.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This image features a close-up view of a brick wall. The bricks have a textured, pinkish-beige surface, and there are visible signs of aging and discoloration, which contribute to a somewhat gritty aesthetic. On the wall, there are several elements of graffiti and stickers.\n\nProminently, the number \"646\" is spray-painted in black on two bricks in the upper left quadrant of the image. Below this number, the phrase \"Bessie Jives\" is also spray-painted in a larger, slightly more expressive black script that covers several bricks.\n\nAdditionally, on the top right of the composition, there is a small rectangular sticker with a red background and white letters that reads \"JESUS LOVES,\" positioned horizontally across one brick. The stickerâ€™s bright color contrasts sharply with the muted tones of the brick wall and the black graffiti.\n\nThe overall composition captures a sense of urban decay and the personal expression found commonly in public spaces through graffiti and stickers. The image depicts a theme of informal, probably unsanctioned communication layered onto the urban landscape.","title":"Graffiti on wall","placename":"Brunswick (Ga.)","location":"Brunswick, Georgia","nn1":["555939","548271","556232","549865","553506","556231","548476","557347","552498","543330","552512","552478","555911","548266","547894","557349"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["sticker","brick","graffiti","spray","wall","number","script","quadrant","discoloration","phrase"]}
