{"path":"553409.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a serene boating scene set in a lush, wooded area. Two individuals are in a small, flat-bottom canoe on a calm, reflective water surface. The person at the front of the canoe, who appears to be a woman, is seated and wearing a yellow raincoat, facing away from the camera and looking toward the water. The person at the back, likely a man, is standing and actively paddling the canoe. He is dressed in casual light-colored clothes, potentially a white shirt and khaki pants.\n\nThe background and surrounding environment are thick with vibrant green foliage, intensifying the sense of seclusion and tranquility. The branches and leaves of the trees overhang the water, partially framing the scene and casting shadows on the surface of the water. The light filtering through the canopy gives a dappled effect, highlighting the natural beauty of the setting. This tranquil moment is enhanced by the gentle ripples in the water around the canoe, suggesting a gentle movement through the otherwise still water. It's an intimate snapshot of a peaceful outing in nature, infused with a quiet, contemplative atmosphere.","title":"Mine falls park consists of three miles of attractive woodland along the shores of the Nashua river.
