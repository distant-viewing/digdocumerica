{"path":"550231.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene by a body of water, likely a river or lake, with multiple activities occurring. In the foreground, a young boy stands on a bank covered in small rocks and debris. He is holding a fishing rod and appears to be engaged in fishing, facing away from the viewer towards the water.\n\nFurther out in the water, three people are interacting with a small powerboat. The individuals are waist-deep in the water. One appears to be on the partially submerged boat, while the other two seem to be assisting or working on it. The boat is positioned almost parallel to the riverbank, and creates small waves around it, indicating recent movement or ongoing activity.\n\nThe water itself has a brownish color, suggesting it might be murky or muddy. The sky is not visible in the image, focusing the viewer's attention on the human activities and the immediate environment. The presence of the boat and the boy fishing portrays a recreational or perhaps a communal working scene by the water.","title":"Fishing in polluted Rocky River.
