{"path":"551128.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene of children playing basketball in a rural or semi-rural setting. At the foreground, three children are actively engaged in playing; one is shooting the basketball towards a makeshift basket. The hoop is mounted on what appears to be either a wooden post or a tree, situated among thick green foliage, which hints at a setting rich in natural vegetation.\n\nTwo boys are seen in motion, one wearing an orange tank top with black shorts, and the other in a stripe-patterned tank top with darker pants. A third child, watching the throw, is partially visible in the background. The ground they are playing on is unpaved, covered in dirt, which adds a rustic feel to their playground.\n\nBeside the play area, there are a few bicycles casually resting against a wooden fence, suggesting the children might have ridden them to this spot. The background includes scattered foliage and another structure, possibly a small building or shed, reinforcing the sense of a community space. The environment is casual and reflects a scene of simple, joyful play, away from urban sophistication. The overall composition beautifully encapsulates a moment of childhood freedom and enjoyment in a natural setting.","title":"Backyard basketball--triangle section of Charleston","placename":"Charleston (W.
