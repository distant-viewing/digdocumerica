{"path":"543276.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a wildlife scene on a body of water, perhaps a lake or river. The primary focus is an otter, visible primarily by its head peeking out from the shimmering surface of the water. The otter looks directly at the camera, with its wet fur glistening. The water has ripples and light reflections indicating either recent movement in the water or a slight breeze. Throughout the water, there are numerous dark shapes and floating debris, possibly leaves or other natural materials. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the blue of the water enriched by the lighting, creating a dynamic and textured appearance. The overall atmosphere suggests a peaceful yet lively wildlife habitat.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["554623","544528","544543","545923","542582","543918","542629","550341","544539","548713","549553","552917","543275","550219","553180","544765"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["wildlife","water","glistening","fur","peek","breeze","enrich","shimmering","habitat","ripple"]}
