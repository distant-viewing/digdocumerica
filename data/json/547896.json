{"path":"547896.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph portrays a scene dominated by contrast between industrial waste and daily domestic life. In the foreground, various metal barrels are scattered across a dirt and debris-covered ground. These barrels appear old and heavily corroded, with peeling paint and signs of rust. Some are upright, while others are tipped over, exposing their empty or debris-filled interiors.\n\nIn the background, separated by a chain-link fence, there is a clear depiction of domestic life: freshly laundered clothes are hung out to dry on a clothesline. The clothes array includes several pairs of pants and sheets, predominantly white, fluttering slightly in what appears to be a mild breeze.\n\nThe setting appears to be an outdoor area behind residential buildings. These buildings, visible in the deeper background, are modest and utilitarian with simple architectural features. The area projects a sense of decay and neglect, highlighted by the presence of industrial barrels and the unkempt state of the ground, juxtaposed with the clean lines of hanging laundry, suggesting resilience or adaptation by the residents. The sky is clear, indicating fair weather, which enhances the visibility of the details in the image.","title":"Rusty oil cans pile up near home in broad channel, a Jamaica bay community with numerous pollution problems","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543806","546004","543762","556324","542494","553433","552884","546000","556158","542549","547950","551075","552883","542507","544823","549270"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["barrels","clothes","corrod","hang","clothesline","flutter","laundry","adaptation","resident","tip"]}
