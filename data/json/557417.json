{"path":"557417.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of a barren, cracked land surface. The earth is parched, displaying a network of deep cracks that create a mosaic pattern amid the dirt. The dominant colors are various shades of browns and whites which suggest dryness and perhaps salinity in the soil. The ground is uneven, with patches of what appears to be salt deposits and scattered darker rocks or clumps of earth which interrupt the otherwise flat terrain.\n\nIn the background, the landscape gently rises, featuring sparse vegetation primarily at a distance. Some scrubby bushes and sparse grasses can be found concentrated mostly on the horizon line. The sky is overcast, suggesting a somber, muted light which enhances the stark, desolate feel of the landscape. There is no visible water or signs of active life in the immediate vicinity, emphasizing the aridness of the location.","title":"Salty tide flat at Upper Newport Bay in Orange County. The bay was scheduled to become a yacht harbor. Coastline construction has declined since the implementation of the state's Coastal Zone Conservation Act in 1973. One state and six regional commissions have authority to regulate construction within 1,000 yards of the shoreline. The commissions must submit a report to the state legislature by January 1976, with recommendations for laws affecting the future of the state's entire coastline.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["552435","549201","544428","549133","552060","544184","552053","550397","552420","544180","544176","545004","544733","544751","555885","552059"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["earth","crack","salt","clump","deposit","vicinity","white","network","bush","brown"]}
