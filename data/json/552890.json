{"path":"552890.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features a striking geological formation, primarily a large, rugged rock outcrop standing prominently in the image. The rock formation is characterized by its vertical ascent and interestingly weathered surface consisting of numerous indentations, holes, and bulbous protrusions, giving it a textured and somewhat porous appearance. The color of the rock is a mix of gray and beige, creating an organic, natural look.\n\nThe ground around the rock is flat, covered with what appears to be a thin layer of sand or dust, and stretches toward the foreground of the photograph, filling the lower part of the frame. The terrain is largely barren and devoid of vegetation, enhancing the desolate and stark feel of the landscape. The surface also shows subtle variations in color, from darker patches to lighter areas, which could be the result of natural mineral deposits or shadow effects.\n\nThe sky in the background is relatively clear with a faint gradation of light, suggesting the time of the photograph might be either during the early morning or late evening, which softens the overall ambiance.\n\nThere are no human figures or man-made objects visible in the scene, focusing all attention on the natural geological features and the landscape itself. The composition uses the rock as a central point, capturing its imposing form and texture, which dominates the visual field against the expansive and empty surroundings.","title":"Tufa rock formations on the east shore of Pyramid Lake, near the island called Fremont's Pyramid.
