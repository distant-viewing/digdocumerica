{"path":"555582.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural scene with a road blocked by a large mound of earth and rocks. In the foreground, the road appears weathered with evident tire tracks and patches of dirt and grass encroaching onto the asphalt surface. A vivid red and white sign is prominently displayed to the right of the frame, stating \"ROAD CLOSED PRIVATE PROPERTY,\" indicating restrictions against further travel.\n\nThe background offers a view of a hazy landscape with rolling hills, patches of trees, and distant farmhouses or buildings that are somewhat obscured by atmospheric conditions, likely mist or dust. The area surrounding the road is lush with green foliage and there are a few trees in close proximity to the roadblock, enhancing the rural and somewhat secluded nature of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of interruption and boundaries within a tranquil countryside setting, perhaps suggesting themes of private ownership and land use in rural areas.","title":"Through a coal company's efforts, this road was closed to traffic to facilitate strip mining.","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["555628","555647","554789","544245","545624","545620","552076","545159","547081","544262","555435","547095","547111","543104","549129","552005"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["interruption","ownership","restriction","road","encroach","farmhouse","countryside","asphalt","tire","property"]}
