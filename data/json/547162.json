{"path":"547162.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene at what appears to be a coastal or lakefront location with strong waves impacting a set of metallic, black gates positioned vertically in water. These gates are likely part of a water control structure such as a lock or flood barrier.\n\nThe gates are sturdy, with visible bolts and hinges, and each has a robust, vertical handle or lever projecting from its front. The action in the image is focused on water violently splashing and spraying as it clashes against and flows through these barriers, indicating a moment of high water pressure or stormy conditions. The water is murky brown, suggesting it might be laden with sediment.\n\nIn the background, beyond the gates, choppy, formidable waves can be observed, hinting at a large body of water, possibly a sea or lake under windy conditions. The sky above is blue, partly suggesting that the turbulent water might not be due to general overcast or rainy weather but could be the result of wind or specific water flow conditions.\n\nThe sharpness and clarity of the water droplets caught in mid-spray contribute to the dramatic and energetic atmosphere of the scene, highlighting the force of nature interacting with man-made structures.","title":"Winter storm on Lake Michigan.
