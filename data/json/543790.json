{"path":"543790.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This image is a moody, artistic photograph taken in low light conditions that notably captures an astronaut's gloved hand slightly out of focus, with the Earth visible in the reflective surface of the visor. The astronautâ€™s helmet and part of the suit, enveloped in darkness, are barely visible and mostly silhouetted against the deep black space. The focus of the image provides a sharp depiction of Earth, which shines brilliantly in the reflection with variegated blue, white, and earthy tones indicating clouds, land, and bodies of water from a high orbital perspective. The composition of the photograph emphasizes solitude and the vastness of space, contrasting the human element, represented by the astronaut, against the grandeur of Earth seen from a unique vantage point often inaccessible to many.","title":"Underground uranium mining","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["548914","550916","553912","553803","551914","547675","557611","546152","550842","555262","548912","555714","557603","553883","555140","551360"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["shine","depiction","darkness","space","envelop","grandeur","represent","helmet","vantage","suit"]}
