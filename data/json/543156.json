{"path":"543156.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene where the foreground is formed by a coastline made up of large, jagged rocks. Seated on these rocks are two individuals engaged in fishing. One is wearing a light-colored hat and a dark shirt, and the other has dark hair, visible from behind. Both are oriented towards the water, presumably watching their lines.\n\nThe midground of the image features a calm body of water, across which a small sailboat is gliding. This boat has a white hull and a sail partially visible in the frame, showing a peaceful maritime activity.\n\nThe background is dominated by an industrial landscape that includes a large power plant. This plant features two tall, slender chimneys emitting no visible smoke and several large spherical storage tanks. Additional structures are part of the plant, suggesting a significant industrial installation. This setup contrasts sharply with the serene, recreational foreground where the individuals are fishing.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of industry and leisure, juxtaposing the mechanical and natural aspects of the environment. The clear sky provides excellent visibility and contributes to the vividness of the scene.","title":"Fishing and boating on Monterey Bay in sight of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","placename":"Moss Landing (Calif.)","location":"Moss Landing, California","nn1":["550902","550942","550941","550221","550937","552291","552139","551959","552051","546001","546079","545191","544976","550899","544186","551162"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["plant","rock","installation","vividness","sail","sailboat","hull","midground","coastline","chimney"]}
