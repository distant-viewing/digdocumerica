{"path":"545526.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of daily life in an area with humble living conditions. In the central foreground, three children are seen engaging in various activities. One child, holding a red and white patterned umbrella, walks on what appears to be a dirt road filled with small debris and litter. Another younger child, wearing a red top and multicolored bottoms, is walking alongside the child with the umbrella, and both are likely moving in the same direction. These children seem focused on their immediate action or destination.\n\nTo the left, another child stands barefoot on the wooden plank stairway of a house, appearing to look out onto the street or possibly interacting with another unseen person or scene. The house he stands by is weathered and washed out, characterized by peeling white paint and raised on stilts, possibly for flood protection.\n\nThe background of the image reveals another child, partially obscured, standing inside the doorway of the adjacent house, looking out towards the others. Similar to the first house, this house also appears in a state of disrepair and is built above the ground on block supports. The environment suggests a lower-income or working-class neighborhood with minimal infrastructure and maintenance.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveys a sense of community interaction among the children in a rustic, urban setting.","title":"Scene in \"Little Korea\", in South Birmingham.
