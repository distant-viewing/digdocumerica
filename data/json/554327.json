{"path":"554327.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph presents a view of passengers inside a subway car, captured through one of its windows. The image features a slightly blurred, motion-captured aesthetic, suggesting it may have been taken from outside the subway as the train was possibly moving or in dim lighting conditions.\n\nThe window frame, featuring scratches and marks, adds a rugged, used look, drawing a contrast with the passengers inside. Inside the subway, multiple passengers can be seen. They are mostly standing, appearing crowded and packed close together, reflective of a busy, rush-hour scene. One woman in the foreground looks directly towards the camera, wearing glasses and a calm expression. Most of the other passengers are blurred, with only some of their features, like hairstyles or items of clothing, distinguishable. Various poses and different degrees of attention or distraction characterize the scene, with some passengers holding on to poles or handles for stability.\n\nThe lighting inside the car is fluorescent, casting a sharp, sterile light over the passengers and highlighting their expressions and the details of the crowded space. Their expressions, where visible, range from neutral to slightly weary or disinterested, typical of daily commuters. The image evokes a sense of everyday urban life and the commonality of public transit experiences.","title":"Subway car","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554326","556669","548256","556665","554328","556817","556780","556691","556661","556653","556654","548261","554370","551895","556813","554323"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["passenger","subway","expression","stability","scratch","rush","distraction","commuter","degree","handle"]}
