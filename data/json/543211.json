{"path":"543211.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a scene in a sandy, dune-covered landscape. A vehicle, appearing to be an off-road buggy or a modified open-framework vehicle, is seen in the middle-right part of the image, with a person visible in the driver's seat. The person seems to be engaged in driving or maneuvering the vehicle.\n\nIn the foreground, on the left side, there is a sign planted in the ground that reads “FRAGILE AREA NO VEHICLES BEYOND THIS POINT SHELL CAMINO”, suggesting that the area where the vehicle is located might be a designated no-driving zone to protect its ecological integrity.\n\nThe background features large sand dunes covered with sparse vegetation. At the top of the central dune, there is a red flag fluttering in the wind, which could be marking a specific area or serving as a warning or navigational aid. The sky is visible with a clear blue tone, indicating fair weather conditions. The entire scene has an adventurous or recreational ambiance, but also hints at a possible disregard for conservation signage, as the vehicle is beyond the sign that prohibits its entry.","title":"Couple in dune buggy","placename":"Zmudowski Beach State Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545098","545102","545071","548986","543208","543370","544038","553056","553058","545596","545094","551969","545109","548897","545604","543207"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["dune","vehicle","disregard","no","aid","entry","warning","conservation","person","seat"]}
