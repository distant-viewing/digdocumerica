{"path":"544313.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a group of tourists riding horses through a narrow canyon. The frame is taken from a darkened foreground, likely from inside another section of the canyon, looking out towards a brightly illuminated landscape. The gorge's towering walls, composed of stratified reddish-brown rock, rise on either side of the canyon path, creating a dramatic and confined route.\n\nThe tourists are mounted on horses, suggesting an organized excursion, typical of a scenic or historical area. They are seen in silhouette against the bright background, indicating that the main source of light is coming from behind them. The ground is rocky and uneven, indicating the rugged terrain of the canyon.\n\nThe backdrop is particularly striking, featuring layered rock formations with varying hues from dark brown to nearly white, shaped by eons of geological activity. In the distance, beyond the narrow passageway where the group is traveling, the canyon appears to open up under a brighter sky, hinting at expansive spaces beyond this tight passage.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of adventure and exploration, emphasizing the majestic and imposing qualities of the natural rock formations through the play of light and shadow.","title":"Entering the GRand Canyon","placename":"Peach Springs (Ariz.)","location":"Peach Springs, Arizona","nn1":["545705","545693","545689","544903","545305","553962","553964","553965","544895","545750","545798","544917","544931","544309","545697","545796"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","tourist","horse","rock","gorge","formation","excursion","confine","darken","group"]}
