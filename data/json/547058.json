{"path":"547058.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a heavily industrial scene likely captured from an aerial viewpoint. The vibrant image shows a large industrial complex emitting massive clouds of white smoke or steam, which dominate the upper portion of the frame. The dense smoke partially obscures some of the industrial structures, which include towering stacks and various buildings.\n\nIn the foreground, at the bottom part of the image, there are two cargo ships docked in a harbor. The ships are laden with cranes and containers, indicating a bustling maritime activity. Alongside the ships, there's a visible cargo of black material, which could be coal or a similar commodity, stored in large heaps by the docks.\n\nThe water around the ships sparkles due to the reflection of the sunlight, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a clear day. To the right of the industrial plant and across a roadway, additional parts of the industrial facility can be seen, including circular storage tanks.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the natural brightness of the day against the dark, smoky output of the industrial operations, reflecting themes of industry and environment. The image captures a moment in time at an industrial harbor, busy with production and transportation activities.","title":"Steel mills on the Calumet River","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["552181","549472","548106","557246","550021","545236","551566","549969","551609","548107","547084","548340","550957","552179","547101","552193"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["ship","harbor","cargo","output","smoke","coal","heap","production","brightness","roadway"]}
