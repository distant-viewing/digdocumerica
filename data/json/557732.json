{"path":"557732.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a gas station or a similar establishment undergoing renovations or construction. The main structure appears to be a single-story building with a white exterior and a slanted roof covered with wooden shingles or siding. There is a newly installed wooden framework for what might be an additional covering or extension of the roof, which sits over a concrete platform possibly intended for refueling vehicles.\n\nOn top of the new wooden framework, a Caucasian male is involved in construction activities, seemingly measuring or adjusting the wooden beams. He is dressed casually in a sleeveless top and jeans. Below him, on the ground, there are several individuals engaged in different activities. A person wearing a dark shirt and pants walks across the scene, conveying a sense of motion. This area appears to be a busy place with people constantly moving.\n\nThe building has large windows protected with decorative metal grills, and the facade features some ornate, albeit simplistic architectural details. On the left side of the building, there are visible elements typical of a gas station, including a gas pump and what might be a price sign.\n\nThe background includes a vibrant green hillside, indicating the station's likely rural or semi-rural setting. This natural backdrop contrasts with the human activity and structural elements in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of everyday life focused on building or refurbishment, with people going about their routines in a rustic or country setting. The image tells a story of work, movement, and rural commerce.","title":"Conversion to the alpine motif of the twin tanks service station at the western edge of the city limits of Helen, near Robertstown on Georgia Highway 17/75","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557730","543594","557728","556619","555373","543591","556635","547858","554426","543544","553922","550273","546988","557943","553924","550737"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["gas","station","framework","story","renovation","covering","extension","grill","country","price"]}
