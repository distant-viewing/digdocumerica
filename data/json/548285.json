{"path":"548285.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a man standing on the stairs in front of a building, which appears to be a seafood market. The man is dressed in a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt and darker trousers, standing casually with one hand in his pocket and the other by his side. He is smiling slightly towards the camera.\n\nThe building behind him is white, with wooden plank siding and features decorative, carved millwork around the porch area. There is a colorful sign on the wall next to the entrance door that reads \"Carlos' Market,\" advertising \"Fresh Daily Manchac Crabs, Fish & Shrimp.\" Another smaller sign right above the door appears to say \"Boiled Catfish.\" To the right of the building, there's a column painted white, adding to the architectural detail.\n\nThe steps the man is standing on are stone or concrete, unpainted, leading up to a very modest porch. Thereâ€™s a small metal trash can to the left of the steps, and the ground in front of the building is just a simple grass area, mingled with some bare spots and small flowers or debris scattered around. The overall setting suggests a sunny, bright day, contributing to a lively and warm atmosphere.","title":"Market on River Road (between New Orleans and Baton Rouge).
