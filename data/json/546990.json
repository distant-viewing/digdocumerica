{"path":"546990.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a dignified elder woman seated on a chair in a homely outdoor setting, possibly on a veranda or a simple porch. She is dressed in a polka-dot dress and wears practical but neat shoes. The woman is engaged in reading a large, open book that rests on her lap, reflecting a calm and thoughtful moment.\n\nThe book appears to be richly illustrated, suggesting it could be a religious text, a storybook, or perhaps a historical volume. A watch and multiple rings on her fingers suggest personal style and perhaps significance to the jewelry she wears.\n\nBeside her, there is the presence of a dog. The dog, which appears to be resting and partly attentive, adds a comforting and domestic touch to the scene.\n\nThe background hints at a modest living environment with a rough-textured wall and an open doorway showing a dark interior, suggestive of a simple, rustic dwelling. The lighting is natural, possibly indicating late afternoon or early evening, which enhances the intimate and serene atmosphere of the setting.\n\nThis image conveys a sense of everyday peace and the personal enjoyment of quiet activities such as reading, enhanced by the presence of a loyal pet and surrounded by a familiar environment.","title":"Bessie Jones, a gospel singer, lives on St. Simon's Island.","placename":"Brunswick (Ga.)","location":"Brunswick, Georgia","nn1":["545525","552611","553485","554193","545510","553535","555580","553481","556033","556421","556549","548613","553484","556576","553483","553089"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["dog","book","pet","jewelry","dwelling","watch","ring","finger","reading","volume"]}
