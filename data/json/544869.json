{"path":"544869.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a lively scene set in a desert with vast sand dunes. A person is depicted energetically running down a steep dune slope. The individual appears joyful and playful, dressed in casual attire with pants and a long-sleeve shirt, and is in mid-motion with arms spread wide and one leg bent up behind them, suggesting a moment of spontaneous fun.\n\nThe background showcases several large, smooth sand dunes under a sky filled with light wisps of clouds, stretching across the horizon. The dunes have a gentle gradient and soft curves, indicative of typical wind-sculpted desert landscapes. The terrain's monochromatic sandy tones range from light beige to golden brown, which contrasts subtly with the vibrant blue of the sky.\n\nThis scene is evocative of freedom, adventure, and the beauty of natural desert environments, emphasizing the vastness and tranquility juxtaposed with human energy and movement.","title":"Great Sand Dunes National Monument","placename":"Colorado","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549037","545199","547717","545701","545102","553058","545203","550490","545200","545196","543097","555399","543498","545207","545766","557459"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["dune","desert","sand","wisp","sculpt","fun","freedom","beige","gradient","adventure"]}
