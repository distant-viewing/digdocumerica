{"path":"553056.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The image captures a dynamic scene of a dune buggy in an off-road setting, enveloped in a large cloud of dust. The dune buggy, positioned on the left of the frame, features a robust, metallic roll cage design, typical for safety in off-road vehicles. Its wheels are partially visible, kicking up massive amounts of dust as the vehicle speeds through a dirt track. The dust cloud is dense and extensive, dominating the scene and obscuring much of the background and the lower part of the vehicle.\n\nThe driver of the buggy is visible and appears focused on navigating the vehicle. He is wearing casual attire typical for a rough outdoor activity, which includes a light-colored T-shirt. His arms are raised, engaged in steering, while his focused gaze is directed forward, indicating intensity and concentration.\n\nThe background is minimalistic and nondescript, primarily consisting of what appears to be shrubbery in the upper left corner, suggesting a rural or undeveloped area typically chosen for such off-road vehicle activities.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes action and movement, underscored by the dramatic billowing of the dust cloud, which visually conveys the speed and power of the dune buggy. The photograph is likely taken during a moment of high activity, capturing the thrill and the rugged environment associated with off-road driving.","title":"Sand vehicle scarring desert terrain of MaRicopa County (from the Documerica-1 exhibition.
