{"path":"542769.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a forestry or logging scene within a dense, wooded area. The focus of the image is a large tree that has been partially cut and is tilting at a steep angle, nearly horizontal, suggesting it is in the process of being felled. The cut section of the trunk is clearly visible with a neatly defined cut.\n\nA worker, wearing a safety helmet and carrying a chainsaw, stands next to the tree, observing it. He appears to be dressed in a grey jacket, blue jeans, and sturdy boots, suitable for outdoor, rugged work. The worker has a safety belt or harness around his waist.\n\nThe setting is a thick forest with many tall trees visible in the background, predominantly conifers, indicating a high-altitude or northern temperate location. The ground is littered with small branches, needles, and forest debris, indicative of recent logging activity. The lighting suggests it might be an overcast day, contributing to the natural, muted tones of the forest environment.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of human interaction with nature, specifically in forest management or logging, in a manner that emphasizes the scale and impact of such activities.","title":"D.
