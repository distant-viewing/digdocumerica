{"path":"551379.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This image captures a tranquil and compelling scene predominantly in shades of deep blue and purple. It features the silhouette of a bird, possibly a heron, captured in mid-flight to the upper left of the frame. The bird is depicted in a slightly blurred motion, giving a dynamic quality to the otherwise serene image.\n\nThe background is dominated by the dark, intricate silhouettes of thick foliage and tree branches, which occupy the majority of the frame, particularly on the right side. These silhouettes create an elaborate pattern of leaves and branches, cutting across the frame in a natural and organic manner.\n\nThe lighting conditions suggest either early morning or late evening, as evidenced by the gradation of blue and purple hues, evoking a peaceful and slightly mysterious ambiance. The use of natural light and the moody color palette enhances the overall mystical and tranquil feeling of the scene.","title":"Immature little green heron flies from tree overlooking Ha Ha Tonka Lake","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["547322","547318","543063","545142","543922","551378","553776","547593","550388","548832","557204","557628","544597","550382","553875","547744"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["silhouette","bird","heron","branch","gradation","majority","frame","flight","manner","purple"]}
