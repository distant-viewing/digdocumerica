{"path":"547350.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a rural landscape, likely captured during the late afternoon based on the lighting and shadows visible. The scene is composed primarily of agricultural lands which are segmented into various patches indicating different crops or fields. There are several large farm buildings including barns and stables clustered around a residential area which features a few small houses.\n\nA long, straight road cuts vertically through the image, providing access to the farmstead and also marking a clear separation between two types of fields â€“ with denser and darker vegetation on the right and more open, possibly plowed fields on the left. Additionally, a small body of water reflects sunlight near the top right corner of the image, further enhancing the variety in the landscape.\n\nThe color palate consists of rich earth tones and greens, a sign of fertile land and dense vegetation typical in farming areas. The shadows suggest high-relief objects like trees around the buildings, contributing to a sense of depth and dimension in the photo. The overall organization of the farm, placement of the buildings, and surrounding natural features depict a well-established, functional agricultural environment.","title":"Farmlands west of Lincoln, center of a vast agricultural region","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547321","547426","547684","558414","547447","547316","542517","547428","547291","557517","547357","548908","556971","553817","547309","552858"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["farm","field","relief","separation","dimension","land","organization","placement","barn","farming"]}
