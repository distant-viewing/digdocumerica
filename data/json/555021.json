{"path":"555021.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures the intricate details of a spider web dazzling with droplets, possibly of morning dew or after a rain. The web is central to the image and spans a variety of small, lush green plants with delicate leaves. These plants have a rich vibrancy and appear slightly blurred in the background, emphasizing the sharpness of the spider web in the foreground.\n\nMany water droplets are strewn across the threads of the web, reflecting light and giving the whole scene a sparkling appearance. There is an insect trapped in the web, visible on the left side of the image. This suggests the operational aspect of the web as a trap. The overall setting appears to be a natural, possibly forested area with the focus on the small and often overlooked drama between predator and prey. The low lighting suggests it might be either dawn or dusk, adding a sort of ethereal quality to the image.","title":"Closeup of moisture absorption by moss and moisture retention by spider webbing in the queets corridor of in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555195","544526","557620","553874","543564","543565","544518","558077","553853","543629","555184","555032","543560","557592","555046","551353"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["web","trap","droplet","thread","drama","insect","sharpness","dew","plant","vibrancy"]}
