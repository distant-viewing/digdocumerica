{"path":"557198.jpg","date":"February 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a dry, dead flower bud covered with ice and snow, symbolizing a stark winter scene. The central object in the image is the dark-colored flower bud, which appears to be from a plant that typically has spiky protrusions, likely a dried seed pod or flower head from a species such as a thistle. The bud's sharp, pointed tips are highlighted by a subtle frosting of ice and are surrounded by clumps of snow, adding textural contrast to the scene.\n\nSeveral of the tips of the bud have distinctly formed ice crystals, showcasing intricate natural ice sculptures against the dark brown of the bud. These ice formations exhibit delicate details and patterned structures, making them appear as if they are clinging or have sprouted from the surface of the dried plant.\n\nThe background is a blurred wash of white and pale blue hues, ensuring the focus remains on the frost-laden flower bud. This soft, almost homogeneous backdrop provides a sense of cold isolation typical of winter scenes, enhancing the chilling effect portrayed by the frost and snow-covered plant life in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the composition leverages the interplay between darkness and light, along with the textures of the icy elements against the rough, desiccated surface of the plant, creating a visually gripping depiction of nature's quiet yet harsh winter beauty.","title":"Kansas sunflower seen in a closeup covered with ice and snow at lake quivira, near Kansas City.  Much of the state was once covered with virgin tallgrass prairie.  Settlers turned the fertile soil by plow and planted crops.  Now only isolated patches of prairie remain.
