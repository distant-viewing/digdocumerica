{"path":"556035.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a candid moment in what appears to be a busy commercial kitchen setting, specifically inside a narrow aisle between kitchen equipment. It features three chefs, each dressed in traditional white chef attire, including white hats, jackets, and aprons. The chef in the foreground is seated and seems to be in the middle of a lighthearted conversation, gesturing with his hand while looking up and smiling at another chef. This second chef, standing to the right, is turned towards the seated chef, engaging actively in the conversation and smiling as well. A third chef, seen in the background and slightly out of focus, is also dressed in a white chefâ€™s uniform and is observing the interaction between the first two chefs with a subtle smile.\n\nThe background shows the interior of a commercial kitchen with stainless steel appliances, kitchen equipment, and warm lighting fixtures hanging from the ceiling. The lighting creates a cozy, inviting atmosphere despite the industrial surroundings. The mood is convivial and relaxed, suggesting a brief break in a possibly hectic kitchen environment or a moment of camaraderie among colleagues.","title":"Chef and cooks in the galley of the Lone Star take a brief rest from their duties of feeding the passengers as the train speeds across Oklahoma enroute between Chicago and Houston, Texas. The dining car offers a variety of fare in different price ranges as well as a children's menu. Passengers also can watch the scenery from an observation car and relax in a lounge car.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554896","556824","545017","552621","557883","555983","549947","554870","543651","557867","545984","553802","557856","551419","544986","554265"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Commercial Activities"],"terms":["kitchen","colleague","appliance","conversation","aisle","apron","camaraderie","equipment","fixture","break"]}
