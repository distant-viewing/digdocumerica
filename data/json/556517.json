{"path":"556517.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts two miners working inside a dark, underground mine. The setting is dimly lit, predominantly by the lights attached to the miners' helmets. Both men are kneeling and seem engaged in a task involving a piece of mining equipment on the ground that resembles a conveyor or a rail track component.\n\nThe men wear work clothes that appear dirty and weathered from use, including sleeveless tops and protective helmets. Their physical gestures suggest a close examination or repair of the equipment before them, and they face each other, possibly communicating about the task at hand.\n\nThe background is dark and indistinct, likely due to the lack of illumination, emphasizing the depth and enclosed nature of the mine. The ground around them is rocky and uneven, strewn with small debris typical of a mining environment. Overall, the image captures the challenging and gritty conditions commonly associated with underground mining work.","title":"Ernest Anderson, shot foreman, left, and Bill Kilgore, cutter, are working on the drill used to make holes for the charge an undercutting machine is seen in the foreground. The work is proceeding at the Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company mine near Jasper and Chattanooga, Tennessee. It is a progressive non-union mine, and sells most of its metallurgical (high grade) coal to Japan.","placename":"Tennessee","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556363","556511","556359","556366","556365","556364","556510","556357","556367","543775","556396","556397","556358","556515","556346","556338"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Miner"],"terms":["miner","mining","mine","helmet","work","task","examination","kneel","equipment","conveyor"]}
