{"path":"545077.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph portrays a man engaged in an activity by the seaside. He wears a dark cap, a blue shirt, and dark pants tucked into knee-high rubber boots, suggesting that he is dressed appropriately for wet conditions. The man is bending over a bright red, rectangular container placed in the shallow water near the shore. He seems to be either placing something into or taking something out of a white bucket.\n\nThe background features the ocean with rolling waves visible under a clear sky, hinting at good weather conditions. The sea's proximity and the waves suggest a location on a beach. The overall composition captures a tranquil yet active scene focused on marine or coastal work, possibly related to marine biology or environmental research, given the unspoiled natural setting and the use of specialized containers and equipment. The image has a slight vintage feel, indicated by its color saturation and the style of the film.","title":"Robert Law, employee of the Quinault Indian Reservation, checks Quinault Beach razor clams monthly for size and quantity.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545080","552290","542556","546334","545208","547020","552288","545076","546984","548956","553953","546298","552289","552286","545086","547504"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["container","biology","wave","rubber","seaside","saturation","knee","film","boot","condition"]}
