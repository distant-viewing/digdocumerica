{"path":"551598.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a scientific experiment in a laboratory setting. The focal point is a man wearing glasses and a light-colored lab coat, engaged in his work. He appears to be pouring a liquid from a small bottle into a funnel, which is directed towards an apparatus.\n\nThe setup includes a glass tank that houses a sizeable gold-colored fish, visible and immersed in water. The tank is placed on a table, surrounded by various pieces of what looks to be monitoring and recording equipment, including rows of devices and wires. Close to the front of the image, there is a long strip of paper running through multiple devices with dials and switches, capturing and documenting data with red ink graphs, likely related to the experiment being conducted.\n\nThe background is somewhat cluttered with more laboratory equipment, hinting at a technically rich and active research environment. Cables, wires, and other lab paraphernalia are intermingled throughout the space, creating a busy yet scientifically engaging atmosphere. This setup suggests an experimental approach involving the study of the aquatic life, specifically the fish's response or behavior to certain treatments or conditions.","title":"National Water Quality Laboratory","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["546353","555249","549333","549604","555250","546284","546287","555281","546277","542666","543801","546278","555280","555251","549605","549332"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["experiment","lab","laboratory","device","fish","wire","setup","recording","tank","intermingle"]}
