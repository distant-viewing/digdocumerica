{"path":"550295.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic city skyline under the captivating play of light and cloud. The overriding element is the celestial drama unfolding above; large, heavy clouds dominate the sky, made even more impactful by the intense rays of light that burst through, creating a chiaroscuro effect. This burst of sunlight brilliantly backlights the clouds, highlighting their silver linings and casting a divine glow.\n\nBeneath this heavenscape, a water body reflects the sunlight, giving the choppy surface a shimmering, metallic look. This wavy surface adds a textural contrast to the soft, bulky forms of the clouds above.\n\nToward the horizon sits the silhouette of a city skyline. The buildings are mere dark shapes against the bright sky, but their outlines suggest a bustling urban landscape. Notable is a tall spire, possibly a church or another high-rise structure, piercing the horizon with its pointed top, adding to the serene yet somber tone of the scene.\n\nThe photograph exudes a mood of tranquility juxtaposed with the dynamic and transient nature of light and weather, capturing a moment where nature and human creation meet in a quiet yet profound dialogue.","title":"Cleveland skyline and Lake Erie at daybreak","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550291","548384","548328","552265","553821","547352","543008","553788","555716","545255","557273","552261","548339","553857","545257","547356"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["cloud","skyline","dialogue","drama","ray","burst","spire","city","sunlight","church"]}
