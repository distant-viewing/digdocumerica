{"path":"546457.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, garden-like setting that appears to be a combination of built and natural environments. In the foreground, numerous trees and shrubs establish a lush green scene. Their trunks and branches intersect the view, creating a natural frame that draws the eye deeper into the image. Leaves litter the ground, indicating either a recent pruning or changes in season.\n\nIn the background, a structure with modern architectural elements is visible. It features clean, straight lines and an open framework possibly made of metal, supporting a partially enclosed space. Large, colorful murals or artworks are attached to the structureâ€™s back wall, introducing vibrant blues, reds, and yellows to the scene. These artworks appear abstract, possibly depicting human-like figures or a chaotic array of shapes and patterns, contributing a cultural or artistic dimension to the scene.\n\nThere are a few indistinct figures who can be glimpsed through the foliage. They might be visitors or passersby, partially obscured and blending into the shaded areas created by the trees. The environment suggests a public or communal space like an art park or a botanical garden, designed to foster leisure and cultural engagement through its integration of art, architecture, and nature.","title":"Mabel mcdowell elementary school","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546505","551649","546534","549516","546460","551739","557257","550075","547784","546535","552400","557281","546450","551705","551104","546559"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["artwork","art","enclosed","mural","foster","passersby","dimension","built","abstract","integration"]}
