{"path":"545756.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an informative display board located at the edge of a scenic viewpoint, overlooking a striking geological formation. The display, titled \"UPHEAVAL DOME,\" describes the geology of the showcased natural structure. It features two detailed diagrams illustrating the dome's layered rock formations, accompanied by text explaining the scientific theories surrounding its origin.\n\nThe panel is mounted on two metallic legs and situated on a red sandstone rock that dominates the area, indicative of typical desert landscapes. Behind the display, a broad, rugged vista unfolds under a cloudy sky. The view looks down into a vast canyon with variegated layers of rock, primarily in hues of red and orange. The uneven, eroded rock faces of the canyon suggest a harsh environment sculpted by natural forces over millennia. The horizon extends far into the distance, enhancing the sense of expansive wilderness typical of such arid regions.","title":"Sign describes Upheaval Dome, perhaps the most interesting geological feature of the Canyonlands. A mile-wide crater, it was formed when a salt dome thrust itself up from beneath the earth. It is said to be the most perfect example of a salt dome in the world.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["544397","545696","544745","543504","545792","545804","545791","545805","545803","544363","544429","545771","545789","544950","545775","545799"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["display","rock","canyon","diagram","geology","millennium","formation","origin","sandstone","vista"]}
