{"path":"550224.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a seemingly rural or natural scene heavily loaded with debris, primarily consisting of wooden logs and branches, scattered across a muddy or swampy area covered with a thin layer of green algae. Two individuals, wearing hats and seems to be dressed in casual, work-appropriate clothing, are engaged in clearing or organizing the wooden debris. They are bending and reaching among the logs, possibly sorting or removing them. The setting is in daytime as indicated by the bright sunlight streaming through thick green foliage in the background, highlighting the natural and dense forest environment surrounding the area. The overall composition conveys a sense of clean-up or recovery work in a natural environment that has been cluttered with woody debris, possibly due to environmental or weather-related events.","title":"Cleanup at Rocky River Dam by members of the Columbia Game Club","placename":"Columbia (Ohio)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545535","544469","550220","554437","544460","545060","553601","554853","552085","545266","555562","553637","554422","542547","554854","548004"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","debris","appropriate","recovery","algae","work","clearing","daytime","up","branch"]}
