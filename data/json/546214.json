{"path":"546214.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up image of several blue crabs that have been caught and are tangled within a fishing net. The intricate mesh of the net overlays burlap sacks, which seem to cushion the base. The crabs, with their distinctive blue shells and hints of orange on their claws, appear freshly caught and are variously entangled in the fibers of the net. The background is out of focus but suggests a sandy or gritty terrain typically seen in waterfront or beach environments. The colors are rich and earthy, with the texture of the burlap sacks adding a coarse, rugged feel to the scene. The overall composition captures the gritty essence of marine fishing activities, emphasizing the natural textures and colors of the materials and crabs.","title":"Crabs","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["552285","544264","543912","545089","543909","545075","542892","545182","554005","544509","545175","545085","548767","548789","546319","543916"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["crab","net","sack","gritty","catch","fishing","entangle","coarse","claw","cushion"]}
