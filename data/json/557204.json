{"path":"557204.jpg","date":"March 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph captures an image of a bird in mid-flight against a backdrop of a muted, overcast sky. The sky contains shades of light purple and blue, giving it a somewhat moody and serene feel. The bird, which is positioned close to the center of the image but slightly towards the right, is silhouetted against the soft lighting of the background, making its features less distinct but emphasizing its spread wings and tail feathers. The bird appears to be in an active flying pose with its wings angled upwards during what could be either a flap or a glide. The overall composition is simple but evokes a sense of freedom and isolation due to the vastness of the empty sky surrounding the solitary bird. The image's borders are black, framing the scene tightly and drawing focus to the central subject.","title":"A solitary lesser sandhill crane with wings extended flies above the Lillian Annette Rowe Bird Sanctuary near GRand Island, Nebraska. It is a major stopping area for 250,000 of these birds during their migration from the Gulf of Mexico to the Yukon Territory and Siberia. The shallow and marshy habitat of the Platte River is what attracts the birds. The area is threatened by a U.S. Corps of Engineers project that would dam and dredge the river.","placename":"Grand Island (Neb.)","location":"Grand Island, Nebraska","nn1":["547322","547593","557208","550382","557628","553875","543873","544547","551379","543922","544605","547318","544609","545142","549772","554646"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","wing","feather","freedom","spread","tail","flight","border","purple","vastness"]}
