{"path":"544204.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"In this lively and colorful photograph, we see a scene full of activity and apparent camaraderie by or on a body of water, likely a river, given its size and calmness. The focus of the image is split between the foreground and background activities involving young men.\n\nIn the foreground, two young men are featured prominently. They are shirtless, revealing tanned and wet skin, likely from swimming or being in water. The man on the left has slick, dark hair and a bright, engaging smile. He is wearing patterned swim shorts. The man on the right, whose hair is darker and tousled, sports a neutral expression and raises his left arm, holding onto what appears to be a metal pole or part of a boat's rigging. His posture and the expression suggest fatigue or relaxation after exertion.\n\nThe background of the image adds depth and context to the scene, capturing a third young man who is mid-action, balancing and walking on what appears to be a makeshift tightrope set up over the water. He is focused and cautious in his movements, contributing a sense of adventure and playful risk to the scene.\n\nFurther adding to the ambiance is the rustic, outdoor setting noticeable through the bright, fluffy clouds in a blue sky and lush greenery in the distance, hinting at a warm, pleasant climate. A part of a boat is visible in the bottom right corner, suggesting that boating and possibly swimming are part of the dayâ€™s activities.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its focus on both the joyful expressions in the foreground and the athletic endeavor in the background, creates a vivid illustration of youthful energy and a carefree summer atmosphere. The inclusion of various elements like the metal pole, rope, and natural surroundings, along with the candid expressions and dynamics of the people, paints a picture of a spontaneous, adventurous day by the water.","title":"Shrimp fishermen, on canal dredged by Getty Oil Company","placename":"Venice (La.)","location":"Venice, Louisiana","nn1":["550829","553405","546349","546337","543943","550228","551165","552150","544805","543944","553438","556295","557737","544185","553436","552116"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Outdoor Sports"],"terms":["expression","man","exertion","pole","illustration","swim","rigging","inclusion","camaraderie","boat"]}
