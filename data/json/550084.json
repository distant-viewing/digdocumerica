{"path":"550084.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts two women engaged with bicycles on the side of a road next to a lush green park area. The setting is marked by a clear, sunny day with bright and natural light enhancing the verdant background.\n\nThe woman on the left is dressed in a white shirt with red and white horizontal stripes on the sleeves, and dark shorts; she's partially facing away from the camera and holding a bike. The bike has a light frame, twin thin tires, and is equipped with a small black pouch attached just below the handlebars and a larger black bag mounted on the rear end of the bike. \n\nThe woman on the right is dressed in a pink shirt and very dark shorts, crouched and interacting with another bike which is dark in color and similarly equipped with thin tires and multiple gears. She is adjusting something on the bike or handling something in the bikeâ€™s basket.\n\nJust next to them is a green and white sign indicating \"Emerald Necklace Bike Route,\" pointing towards an established or recommended cycling path through the area. There is a green trash can adjacent to the sign. In the background, another man and woman can be glimpsed walking, hinting at a leisurely, active environment. \n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of preparation or maintenance likely before or after a ride, set in a peaceful, recreational outdoor setting.","title":"Getting ready to enjoy the new bicycle path in Rocky River reservation, part of the metropolitan park system","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["545287","551545","552340","548573","550689","557535","550069","551681","551456","555499","547241","551451","543497","557990","547209","547701"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["bike","woman","tire","short","twin","handlebar","equip","cycle","crouch","basket"]}
