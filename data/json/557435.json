{"path":"557435.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph presents a rural landscape scene, capturing a significant contrast between nature and anticipated urban development. In the foreground, there is a large sign that reads \"FUTURE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES\" and indicates an opening year of \"1976.\" The sign features a simplistic graphic of a house, depicting the type of homes planned for construction.\n\nAround and behind the sign, a group of cattle roam and graze on a vast, grassy field. The field stretches back to a backdrop of rolling hills, which dominate the scene with their dry, rugged appearance. These hills are barren, with only sparse vegetation, emphasizing a natural and undeveloped landscape.\n\nThe setting conveys a sense of impending change, contrasting the current pastoral scene with the prospect of residential development. The photograph captures this juxtaposition in a single frame, highlighting themes of development and the transformation of landscapes. The environment appears peaceful and undisturbed but is marked by the sign as a future site of human habitation and construction.","title":"Site of future single-family homes scheduled to open in 1976 is shown in the","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["557438","557419","547652","543106","546102","553831","557436","557726","553129","557530","544118","553938","557439","555645","549214","557476"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["development","sign","graphic","transformation","cattle","construction","field","hill","year","opening"]}
