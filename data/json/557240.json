{"path":"557240.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"The photograph displays a serene river scene characterized by the presence of foam patterns floating on the water's surface. The foamy patches are irregular and dispersed, creating an interesting natural texture that contrasts against the calm, dark water. In the background, the opposite shore is visible with industrial structures, including large cylindrical storage tanks and buildings, which indicate a level of human activity and industrial presence. The vegetation along the riverbank is minimal and sparse, suggesting a less naturalistic environment, possibly due to the industrial setting. The overall lighting in the image suggests either early morning or late afternoon, as the light appears soft and not overly harsh. This setting evokes a sense of quietness, though juxtaposed with the signs of industrial life. There are no visible people or moving objects, conveying a static, somewhat tranquil scene with a distinct human footprint.","title":"The McKeesport sanitary sewage treatment facility discharge shows suds created by detergents floating in the Monongahela River at McKeesport, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.","placename":"McKeesport (Pa.)","location":"McKeesport, Pennsylvania","nn1":["547502","550370","547650","557238","545164","557252","547807","557239","557234","553388","550686","545168","552137","550849","550369","543194"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["quietness","footprint","foam","riverbank","presence","tank","level","shore","storage","afternoon"]}
