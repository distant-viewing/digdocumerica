{"path":"543632.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a small, partially sunlit water body surrounded by natural vegetation. The focus of the image is the contrast between natural elements and a piece of litter—a white, styrofoam cup—that has been discarded in the water. The water itself shows reflections and sparkles from the sunlight, with visible aquatic plants and algae. Small, green plants, likely young grass or similar, are growing on the edges of this water body. The disturbance in the serene natural setting is highlighted by the presence of the styrofoam cup, which is partly submerged and contrasts sharply with the dark, earthy tones of the wet soil and the rich green of the plants.","title":"Scum along the Truckee River","placename":"Tahoe City (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe City, California","nn1":["550812","553871","550807","552811","547525","550806","552054","543877","550811","550690","544647","548090","555784","547537","547541","547513"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["cup","plant","sparkle","algae","litter","disturbance","water","body","soil","reflection"]}
