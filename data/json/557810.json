{"path":"557810.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph depicts a vibrant cheese shop scene. A woman in traditional dress, possibly Swiss-inspired with an apron and bodice, is standing behind a counter filled with assorted cheeses and sausages. She is interacting joyfully with her customers, actively cutting and presenting cheese samples on a wooden board. There's a large white scale to her right, and various cheese packages and meats fill the refrigerated display below.\n\nOn the customer side, a man and a young child are engaging with the woman. The man, wearing a dark polo shirt with a horizontal white stripe and slacks, leans over the counter looking interested in the selection, while the young child, dressed in a light blue shirt and patterned shorts, watches the woman cutting the cheese. \n\nThe atmosphere looks cheerful and busy, enhanced by decorations such as flags hanging overhead, which likely represent different countries or regions famous for their cheese varieties. The shop has a cozy and inviting feel, suggested by the close interaction between the vendor and customers, and the variety of gourmet food items on display. This setting seems to be indoors, possibly at a local market or specialty food store.","title":"Interior of the Cheese Hoop, one of the specialty shops in Helen.
