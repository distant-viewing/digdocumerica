{"path":"550710.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This image captures a dramatic industrial scene adjacent to a turbulent river. The foreground is dominated by churning, foaming water that appears brownish and filled with sediment, indicative of a fast-moving river possibly swollen by recent rains. The eye is then drawn to the middle ground, where a large industrial complex with multiple buildings and smokestacks is visible. Thick, white smoke billows from several tall smokestacks, contrasting starkly with the darker hues of the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe background features rolling hills that fade into a haze, likely due to either atmospheric conditions or pollution from the industrial activity. The sky is overcast with gray clouds, contributing to the somber and moody atmosphere of the scene. The overall color palette is quite dark, with deep blues and grays dominating, punctuated by the white of the smoke and the brownish-white of the river's froth.\n\nThere is a sense of gritty realism in the photograph, emphasizing themes of industrial impact on natural environments. The juxtaposition of the wild river and the structured industrial facility highlights a stark contrast between nature and human-made landscapes.","title":"Oxford paper company mill viewed from the bridge across the androscoggin river connecting the towns of rumford and mexico","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["550725","550684","550673","550672","557376","546705","551156","547084","546080","550332","551192","543813","557295","557225","550860","557246"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["river","white","smokestack","dominating","realism","froth","churn","smoke","punctuate","sediment"]}
