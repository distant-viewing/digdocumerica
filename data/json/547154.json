{"path":"547154.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph features a lighthouse scene set against rough, churning sea waves. The lighthouse, which stands prominently to the right side of the frame, is painted in a traditional red and white color scheme and is topped with a black lantern room possibly housing the light. It is connected to the shore by a long, narrow pier which has railings and appears sturdy, but the turbulent sea splashes around and under it, suggesting strong winds and heavy weather.\n\nThe ocean is filled with dominant waves showing varying shades from deep blue to dirty white foam, indicating their strength and the possibly treacherous conditions. The sky above is a vivid blue, showing no signs of clouds or impending bad weather, which contrasts sharply with the agitation in the water.\n\nIn terms of composition, the image is balanced with the lighthouse and pier anchoring the scene horizontally, while the vertical sprays of water add a dynamic aspect to the static structure. The lighthouse and connecting pier are centrally aligned, drawing the viewer's eye straight to them amidst the chaos of the natural environment surrounding them. The severe conditions underscore the purpose and resilience of such coastal structures.","title":"Lighthouse and seawall stand against waters of Lake Michigan in winter gale","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547131","543086","545118","543141","550362","550361","544996","551600","546151","547118","547916","543403","543291","545226","548079","549375"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["lighthouse","pier","wave","lantern","sea","strength","chaos","blue","weather","spray"]}
