{"path":"557125.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This image captures a large flock of birds in mid-flight against a clear sky. The scene is densely populated with numerous birds, each spread across the frame, creating a dynamic pattern of wings and bodies. The feathers of the birds are predominantly white with dark patches, suggesting they may be a kind of seabird or similar species.\n\nThe background is a plain, light blue sky with no clouds visible, emphasizing the movement and the sheer number of birds present. The composition of the photograph is filled almost entirely with the birds, with very little sky visible around them. This gives a sense of crowding and the bustle of activity as the flock moves as one cohesive unit. The image captures the fluid motion and chaotic, yet organized, nature of a bird flock in migration or transit.","title":"Airborne flocks of blue geese and snow geese stop at the squaw creek national wildlife refuge near Mound City, Missouri, at the northwest corner of the state.
