{"path":"547068.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a seaside scene, likely captured during twilight or under low-light conditions, adding a dramatic effect with saturated hues. The central subject of the image is a narrow, vertical structure, possibly part of a pier or dock facility, built largely from bricks and edged with metal railings. This structure extends vertically across the frame, highlighting its linear and rugged architectural features.\n\nAt the top of the structure, various antennas and other communication or signaling equipment are installed. These include at least two prominent antenna arrays and a metallic structure that might serve as a small beacon or navigational aid. These installations suggest the structure might serve a functional purpose related to maritime communication or surveillance.\n\nThe ocean serves as the background, displaying a turbulent surface that resonates with waves and ripples, indicating windy conditions or approaching inclement weather. The water reflects the twilight tones, adding moodiness to the scene.\n\nThere are no visible people or moving objects, which emphasizes the isolation and potentially inhospitable nature of the location. The overall ambiance is slightly eerie, reinforced by the solitary construction against the vast, dynamic ocean.\n\nThis image captures an interesting intersection of human-built structures and the natural environment, conveying themes of solitude, resilience, or possibly abandonment, depending on viewer interpretation. The high saturation and coloration of the photo intensify these themes, making the scene appear almost otherworldly.","title":"Over the rooftops to Lake Michigan","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["543242","543359","547118","547143","547131","547147","553772","543320","543405","547112","543288","543364","547091","557510","550310","547044"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["antenna","communication","twilight","ocean","structure","surveillance","interpretation","aid","theme","coloration"]}
