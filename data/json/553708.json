{"path":"553708.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a woman in profile, smiling as she looks slightly to her right. She appears to be dressed in a traditional or ceremonial outfit, which includes a white cape or shawl draped elegantly over her shoulders. The cape is secured at the front with a large, ornate lei made of pink and cream flowers, further embellished with a red ribbon.\n\nHer hair is styled in an updo adorned with what seems to be small red flowers, enhancing her festive or formal appearance. The lighting in the photograph highlights the bright, vibrant colors of the flowers against the deeply shadowed background and the smooth, white fabric of her attire.\n\nThe background of the image is dark and unobtrusive, providing a stark contrast that emphasizes her radiant smile and the vivid colors of her lei and hair accessories. Overall, the image captures a moment of joy and celebration, focusing on cultural garments and the grace of the woman depicted.","title":"Dressed for Aloha Day parade during annual Aloha Week festivities","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553916","553918","553915","553917","553760","556134","556150","553711","556143","557157","553715","553737","556281","558235","551384","556142"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["flower","shawl","grace","ribbon","accessory","garment","hair","celebration","cream","joy"]}
