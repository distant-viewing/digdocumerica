{"path":"557534.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a rocky hillside dominated by large boulders covered with graffiti. The graffiti includes various names and phrases in different colors, prominently displaying \"TWILIGHTERS,\" \"WES,\" \"IVES,\" and \"B MARS\" among others. The term \"SAN PEDRO\" is also visible, possibly signifying the location or a reference. The rocks have a rough texture and are reddish-brown in color. The background shows more distant hills with sparse vegetation under a partly cloudy sky. Additionally, there are utility poles and lines visible stretching across the hills in the distance. The overall scene is devoid of visible human activity, focusing entirely on the natural landscape and the human markings on it.","title":"Graffiti defaces rocks in Malibu Canyon near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543079","557118","557536","542915","554555","545613","545682","551233","549136","544902","548271","552685","544102","543641","555592","551520"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["reference","phrase","graffiti","boulder","hill","marking","term","hillside","name","utility"]}
