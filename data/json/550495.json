{"path":"550495.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a set of large, bleached elk antlers lying on the ground amid low vegetation that suggests a late summer or early autumn setting. The antlers are prominent in the foreground, their elaborate and numerous points reaching into the air, displaying indications of natural wear and weathering. The background of the image is a wide open field, blurring towards the horizon under a cloudy, overcast sky. This gives the entire scene an isolated, serene, yet slightly somber mood, further complemented by the muted colors of the vegetation and the subdued lighting conditions. The landscape suggests a wild and remote area, possibly a mountainous or high plain region. The composition of the photograph brings an immediate focus to the antlers, highlighting their complex structure and the intricate beauty of their natural form, while the backdrop provides a sense of scale and unspoiled wilderness.","title":"Caribou shed their antlers annually; they can be found almost anywhere on the north slope, or here, in the atigun valley the site of pump station #4 appears on the skyline of the hill in the background","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550494","552691","550485","543022","542964","558368","550380","555068","546163","550384","544571","552699","542599","544623","550385","545898"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["antler","bleach","indication","weathering","bring","blur","reach","autumn","isolate","complement"]}
