{"path":"551570.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial and transport landscape. At the heart of the image is a large, dark blue body of water with a dam-like structure at one end. A bridge crosses over the river, connecting one side to the other, with vehicles visible on the road. Alongside the bridge are rail tracks that help define the organized transport system in the area.\n\nTo one side of the river, there are large industrial buildings that extend along the riverside, equipped with parking lots and several smaller structures. Rail tracks run parallel to the river, hinting at a complex network used possibly for freight handling associated with the industrial facilities nearby.\n\nThe area surrounding the water body and industrial sites is lush with greenery, with patches of dense trees and some cleared areas showing grassy fields. The image also captures the texture of the vegetation and industrial surfaces under bright sunlight, revealing the contrasts in color and form between natural and man-made environments. It provides insight into the integration of industrial, transportation, and natural elements within the landscape.","title":"Con-wed plant at cloquet discharges \"white water\" into a side channel of the st.
