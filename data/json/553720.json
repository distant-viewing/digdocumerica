{"path":"553720.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban freeway during what appears to be early morning or late afternoon, given the warm sunlight casting long shadows. The freeway is packed with a variety of vehicles, including cars, vans, and a few trucks, arranged in multiple lanes. The traffic on the left side of the freeway is dense, with vehicles closely packed together, advancing in a moderately congested flow. In contrast, the right side shows a lighter traffic flow where vehicles are more spaced out.\n\nA notable road sign is visible on the right side of the image, displaying \"END FREEWAY 1/2 MILE,\" indicating that the freeway is nearing its termination point. The road itself curves slightly to the right as it progresses into the distance, helping guide the viewer's eye through the scene.\n\nThe surrounding area includes tall trees and urban infrastructure. There is a pedestrian overpass that spans across the freeway, likely for safe crossing over the busy road. The lighting conditions suggest that the sun is low in the sky, casting elongated shadows and giving the scene a golden hue, adding a serene quality to the otherwise busy and mundane commute scene. The overall composition and elements suggest a typical urban freeway environment, busy with daily commuters and surrounded by city infrastructure.","title":"H-1 (or Lunalilo) Freeway","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["547823","547785","556194","549890","553727","553722","549902","553726","546571","555437","542764","545451","546612","545432","546686","553018"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["freeway","flow","traffic","road","vehicle","commute","commuter","crossing","infrastructure","overpass"]}
