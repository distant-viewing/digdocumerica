{"path":"547919.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor swimming pool area that is closed and appears deserted and somewhat dilapidated. In the foreground, there is a lifeguard chair made of metal, prominently displaying a sign with the words \"POOLS CLOSED NO SWIMMING\" in capital letters. The pool itself is filled with water but the surface shows signs of neglect, with debris and discoloration evident.\n\nThe pool's surrounding edge is stained and shows clear signs of wear and rust, particularly visible along the metal barriers and railings. There are drainage grates seen along the poolside, one directly underneath the lifeguard chair.\n\nIn the background, there is a modernist style building with several repeating windowed units that create a patterned facade. This buildingâ€™s color palette is neutral, mostly gray and black. The sky is overcast, adding to the bleak and abandoned atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of abandonment and disuse, highlighted by the aging infrastructure and the clear no swimming sign, suggesting the pool has been out of operation for some time.","title":"\"silver gull private swimming club\" at breezy point, near Jamaica bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["558143","552012","553860","542979","558144","548549","550719","548085","548083","555891","558000","545977","552457","557717","550223","552490"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["pool","chair","sign","bleak","repeat","swimming","drainage","discoloration","disuse","stain"]}
