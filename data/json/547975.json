{"path":"547975.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a landfill or dump site, featuring a large, white sanitation truck in a state of disarray. The truck's cargo area is tilted upwards and open, suggesting it is in the process of offloading refuse onto a large pile of garbage. Surrounding the truck, scattered waste materials—such as metal parts, paper, plastic bags, and what appears to be household debris—cover the ground. On the right of the truck, a large, curved metal sheet, possibly part of the truck's structure, lies detached on the pile.\n\nIn addition to the sanitation truck, there is another piece of heavy machinery, yellow in color, partially visible to the left side of the photograph. This seems to be involved in managing the waste, possibly moving or compacting it.\n\nThe scene is bustling with activity from several seagulls, flying above and around the truck, likely attracted by the garbage. The sky overhead is somewhat overcast with a muted blue tone, giving the scene a subdued lighting.\n\nThis photograph not only depicts waste management through the use of sanitation machinery but also hints at environmental issues, such as waste disposal and wildlife interaction with human waste environments. The mood is somewhat gritty, underscored by the disorganized pile of refuse and the seemingly chaotic activity at the site.","title":"Landfill operation is conducted by the city of New York on the marshlands of Jamaica Bay.
