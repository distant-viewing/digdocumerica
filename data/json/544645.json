{"path":"544645.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph features a direct, low-angle view of an open road extending into the distance under a dramatic and cloud-filled sky. The road is characterized by a textured asphalt surface painted with a bright yellow center line that leads the viewerâ€™s gaze towards the horizon. The sides of the road are lined with grass and flat terrain, sporadically accompanied by telephone poles, hinting at rural or semirural surroundings.\n\nThe sky dominates a significant portion of the image, filled with large, fluffy clouds, which appear dense and slightly stormy. This contributes a dynamic and somewhat moody atmosphere to the scene. The setting is desolate, with no visible vehicles or people, enhancing a sense of solitude and vastness. The composition effectively utilizes the perspective of the road and the expansive sky to convey a journey or a path leading into the unknown, invoking themes of travel, exploration, or introspection.","title":"U.S. 27 between Miami and CLewiston","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544598","545367","554127","544178","548673","544116","544043","547354","554154","544490","554131","550390","547659","549013","549182","545886"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","introspection","telephone","asphalt","journey","cloud","gaze","travel","exploration","vastness"]}
