{"path":"544070.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and somewhat mystical mountainous landscape, depicting multiple layers of mountain ridges receding into the distance. The scene is enveloped in atmospheric haze, contributing to a sense of depth and mystery. The ridges are highlighted by soft lighting, possibly indicating either dawn or dusk due to the soft, diffuse light. The sky is partially cloudy, with scattered clouds adding texture to the otherwise misty backdrop.\n\nThe color palette of the image is quite muted, primarily consisting of grays and blues with subtle earth tones, which emphasizes the tranquil and isolated nature of the landscape. The photograph has a grainy texture and shows signs of wear, such as scratches and specks, suggesting it is an old or vintage photo.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the interplay of light and shadow over the contours of the mountains, crafting a calm yet dramatic natural scene devoid of any human activity or man-made objects. The layering of the mountains and the haze create a distinct sense of immense scale and the vastness of nature.","title":"Mountain range west of Globe","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542676","546764","552695","557558","542923","554398","543023","555378","554634","542681","554402","557519","550421","555131","557000","552173"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["ridge","mountain","haze","layering","scratch","speck","mystery","craft","recede","envelop"]}
