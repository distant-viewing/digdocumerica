{"path":"556137.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The photograph is a close-up portrait of an elderly black man wearing a stylish hat and a white suit. The hat is white with a black band and appears to be of a soft, structured style. His face is detailed with lines and wrinkles that suggest maturity and depth of character. His expression is serene and contemplative with a slight, welcoming smile, enhancing his approachable demeanor. His eyes are looking directly at the camera, creating a strong connection with the viewer.\n\nHe wears a white suit jacket, visible partially, and the background of the image is blurred and indistinct, focusing all attention on him. The lighting highlights his facial features and the texture of his hat, adding depth and warmth to the image. The overall tone of the photograph is calm and dignified, captured with a shallow depth of field to emphasize the subject at the foreground.","title":"Man in Washington Park used by blacks on Chicago's South Side. He is one of nearly 1.2 million black people who make up over one third of the city's population. It is one of the many black faces in this project that portray life in all its seasons. They are portraits of people living life as they find it, as individuals who are proud of their heritage.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556133","556149","554857","548226","554858","557056","547179","548426","553091","552103","556478","556452","548236","549199","547282","552648"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["hat","suit","maturity","depth","wrinkle","portrait","band","warmth","smile","demeanor"]}
