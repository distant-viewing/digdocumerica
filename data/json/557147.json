{"path":"557147.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a relaxed and casual outdoor scene, likely from a camping trip. In the foreground, several individuals are sprawled out on the ground, apparently resting or asleep. They are lying on colorful sleeping bags placed atop a large red tarp, which is spread out on a grassy field. The sleeping bags are mostly blue, with some featuring red and yellow hues.\n\nIn the background, the setting includes two vehicles and two tents. To the left, thereâ€™s a green and white automobile (appearing to be a classic model) and a darker-colored station wagon with luggage or equipment strapped to its roof. Next to these cars, there is a green and yellow tent that has a conical shape and another red tent that is less distinctly visible.\n\nThe surrounding environment suggests this could be an expansive grassy area, possibly in a rural or semi-rural setting, under clear blue skies with no visible clouds, which indicates good weather. Overall, the image portrays a moment of peaceful relaxation amid nature, with a group of people enjoying a break from active pursuits to simply rest and enjoy the outdoors.","title":"Some of the students camped out while attending the second annual Tallgrass Prairie National Park Conference held at a YWCA camp at Elmdale, Kansas, attended by members of Save the Tallgrass Prairie, Inc., Kansas chapter of the Sierra Club and National Audubon Society.
