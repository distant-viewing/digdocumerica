He is dressed in a white cap and a blue striped shirt under a gray jumper. He is wearing yellow rubber gloves, suggesting that he is handling substances that require protection. The man is pouring a liquid from a large steel container into a glass bottle through a funnel. The bottle is transparent and labeled, placed on top of a dark-colored machine or surface that appears suited for the task.\n\nThe background features whitewashed walls and a portion of what looks like steel machinery. The environment is functional and utilitarian, typical of a factory or laboratory setup. The man appears focused and careful as he performs his task, indicating professionalism and experience in his field. The overall lighting is soft, with natural light possibly coming from a nearby source, highlighting the sceneâ€™s industrial aspects.","title":"On epa's experimental farm, technician pours fresh milk into sample container for shipment to lab for radiation tests","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["558306","555244","555243","555245","558350","546278","558379","558380","549611","546032","549605","542666","546295","543801","546277","543706"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["task","bottle","steel","professionalism","funnel","rubber","pour","protection","glove","liquid"]}
