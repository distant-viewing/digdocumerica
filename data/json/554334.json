{"path":"554334.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures a vast and densely packed pile of discarded automotive engines and mechanical parts. The scene is set outdoors, with the ground visible in the foreground showing dirt and tire tracks, suggesting the location could be a salvage yard or a dumping ground for automotive waste.\n\nThe engines and parts appear old and worn, covered in grime and rust, indicating long-term exposure to the elements. They are piled haphazardly, creating an irregular, textured mountain of metal. Various components are discernible, including engine blocks, transmissions, and possibly some smaller parts like pistons and gears. This heap dominates the frame, extending throughout the photograph from the foreground to the background.\n\nThe overall color palette of the image is muted, dominated by the earthy tones of rust and the brownish-red of the dirt, with subtle variations of greys and metallic sheens from the different materials. The lighting is flat, possibly due to an overcast sky, which adds to the industrial and somewhat dystopian feel of the scene.\n\nThere is no human presence or activity visible in the photograph, focusing entirely on the environmental and mechanical aspect. The background blends seamlessly with the pile, not offering any distinct features, thereby highlighting the vastness and overwhelming scale of the waste.","title":"AutoMobile scrap reclamation yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554335","554318","554300","542585","547625","548147","553006","554301","547611","547777","552740","554357","552765","542656","553005","542590"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["engine","pile","rust","waste","salvage","grime","dumping","dirt","heap","term"]}
