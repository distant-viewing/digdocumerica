{"path":"544292.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene dominated by a dirt road that runs horizontally across the frame. A large, pale yellow truck approaches on the road, coming towards the foreground on the right side. The road appears muddy with metal tracks laid down, possibly for stabilization. On the left, there's a wooden fence with multiple signs posted. The primary sign visible in the foreground is large and white with black lettering stating \"NO Fishing ARe Hunting Behind Bridge\" along with a silhouette of a fish and an announcement of a \"$50 fine.\"\n\nBehind this sign, another sign, mostly obscured, includes text about trespassing and penalties, mentioning \"GOLDEN RANCH PLANT.\" The environment features tall grass or crops, and several utility poles lined up along the left side of the road, extending into the distance. In the background, a large barn or farm building with a rusty metal roof is visible. The sky is bright and scattered with clouds, suggesting a sunny day. The overall scene captures a blend of human-made and natural elements typical of a countryside setting.","title":"Posted sign at sugar cane plantation","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556429","552079","553662","544262","555647","556986","544767","544061","552819","544245","554130","543173","556615","555858","557468","555818"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["road","sign","trespassing","ranch","approach","countryside","barn","metal","lettering","fish"]}
