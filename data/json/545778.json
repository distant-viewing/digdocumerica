{"path":"545778.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an atmospheric nighttime scene where a group of people are gathered around a campfire in a natural outdoor setting, reminiscent of a cave or a large rocky alcove. The warm glow of the fire illuminates the scene predominantly in red and orange hues, casting long shadows and creating a smoky ambiance.\n\nThe fire itself is central and vivid, with flames leaping up and consuming the wood. The group of people, visible as dark silhouettes with indistinct features, are seated on the ground, some on what appear to be rocks or logs. They appear relaxed and engaged in casual conversation, enjoying the warmth and light provided by the fire.\n\nThe background is dominated by a curved, looming rock face that underscores a sense of enclosure and intimacy. The texture of the rock is rough and uneven, suggesting a rugged natural environment. The top portion of the image fades into darkness, highlighting the isolation and focus on the lit area around the fire.\n\nOverall, the composition and the use of lighting evoke a feeling of seclusion and camaraderie as the group shares this private moment away from the bustle of day-to-day life.","title":"Camping at night during a week-long hiking trip through water canyon and the maze, a remote and rugged region in the heart of the canyonlands.
