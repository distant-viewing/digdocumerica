{"path":"547583.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at what appears to be an industrial or construction site with heavy machinery. In the foreground, a large mechanical excavator dominates the image. The excavator is seen from the side, showing off its bulky red cabin and a substantial articulated arm. At the end of this arm, a massive bucket with various teeth is suspended in the air, suggesting either a pause in work or the display of the machine's capabilities.\n\nThe backdrop features a relatively bleak and open landscape, primarily flat with sporadic vegetation, which hints at an unused or derelict industrial area. A tall crane structure, painted in black and with visible signs of rust and wear, stands in the background, further emphasizing the industrial use of the space. Nearby, there is a squat, red building, which might serve as a storage or utility building based on its simple, functional architecture.\n\nThe sky is overcast, casting a moody tone over the scene which is enhanced by the aging and weathered condition of the equipment and buildings. The color palette is subdued, primarily consisting of rusts, reds, and the dull green of sparse grass, which conveys a sense of abandonment or disuse.","title":"State Pier on Narragansett Bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["555644","554826","544098","555607","555586","545888","555633","556325","552814","545665","556506","555631","555593","542538","554827","552418"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["excavator","rust","arm","tooth","capability","disuse","pause","suspend","aging","cabin"]}
