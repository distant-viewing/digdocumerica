{"path":"550655.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic natural scene, possibly of a river heavily laden with floating debris. The body of water is wide and appears turbulent, filled with what looks like pieces of wood, bark, and other plant material, suggesting the aftermath of a flooding event or significant runoff. The water extends from the foreground deep into the midground of the image, surrounded by dense, lush greenery on both sides. In the background, a forested hill or low mountain can be seen, adding to the sense of a secluded, natural environment. The sky is mostly clear with a few fluffy, white clouds, and it is a sunny day based on the brightness and shadows in the image. This scene is a powerful depiction of nature's force and beauty, illustrating how waterways can change rapidly with environmental conditions.","title":"Androscoggin River near the headwaters, looking downstream from the bridge at Errol.","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["550698","549550","550658","550742","553855","546111","542537","550222","553653","550717","553416","549482","553420","549542","552953","555209"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["runoff","flooding","aftermath","depiction","force","bark","brightness","midground","waterway","change"]}
