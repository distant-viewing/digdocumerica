{"path":"547801.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and densely decorated cemetery. The foreground prominently features various tombstones of different shapes, sizes, and materials; some are simple crosses, while others are elaborate stone slabs. Many are adorned with colorful artificial and real flowers, wreaths, and personal memorabilia. A notable diversity in the style of memorials indicates a rich cultural backdrop, possibly reflecting the varied heritages of the deceased.\n\nThe center of the image showcases one tombstone with inscriptions in Spanish, depicting the name \"Elena Rocha,\" dates \"1901-1978\" and a personal message, indicating she is fondly remembered (\"RECORDADO,\" meaning 'remembered' in Spanish) by her son, Jose Ortega. This heartfelt detail suggests a close-knit community aspect and the personal significance of the site to those it commemorates.\n\nThe background reveals a residential setting, with modest homes and lush gardens visible behind a chain-link fence, suggesting that the cemetery is located in a community-centric area where the living and the deceased remain in close proximity. Shrubs and trees within and around the cemetery add to a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, providing a serene resting place. The overall ambiance is one of respect and remembrance, vibrantly expressed through the meticulous care and decoration of the graves.","title":"Mexican cemetery near San Juan Capistrano Mission after \"Day of the Dead\" (All Saints Day) rituals","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["544267","550364","546147","545314","545322","547417","550365","552017","545357","545364","552683","557942","555566","552735","548239","544427"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cemetery","tombstone","centric","remembrance","respect","express","slab","grave","inscription","heritage"]}
