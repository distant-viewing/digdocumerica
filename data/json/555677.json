{"path":"555677.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a lush, mountainous landscape. The majority of the image shows a dense expanse of coniferous trees covering undulating hills across the terrain. The trees exhibit a variety of green hues, suggesting a rich, healthy forested area.\n\nTowards the center and bottom of the image, the scene is dissected by a wide river that meanders through the landscape. The river appears swollen, possibly due to snowmelt or recent rainfall, and its banks are broad, filled with what might be sand or sediment. This creates lighter colored patches contrasting sharply with the dark greens of the forest.\n\nAlso notable within the terrain are several small snow patches scattered in areas shielded from direct sunlight, likely nestled on north-facing slopes or within deep ravines, hinting at the high altitude or northern latitude of the location.\n\nNo human activities, structures or people are immediately visible in this wilderness, emphasizing the natural, undisturbed state of the environment. The photograph primarily displays the serene beauty and ruggedness of a secluded, forest-clad mountainous area, accessible primarily from above.","title":"View southeast toward the Lowe River (foreground) and the north portal of the Keystone Canyon.
