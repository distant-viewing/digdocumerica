{"path":"545897.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of wide, geometric agricultural fields adorned by an array of livestock. The fields display varying shades of brown and black soil, possibly indicating different types of crops or stages of tilling. Among these fields, sections are clearly demarcated by straight paths or dirt roads that crisscross the terrain.\n\nThe fields are dotted unevenly with numerous white and dark specks, which are likely animals, possibly sheep or cattle, scattered across the landscape. These animals add a dynamic element to the otherwise static agricultural patterns. The photo captures a man-made landscape where agriculture and animal husbandry are practiced in a structured and orderly manner, emphasizing the human impact on natural environments. The use of straight lines and clear demarcations for the roads and field boundaries suggests a highly organized approach to land use.","title":"Texas--Houston","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["553047","558414","548907","557517","542517","548908","554029","548905","542708","553977","549253","548902","552858","549098","542710","547684"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["field","animal","demarcation","sheep","cattle","approach","use","speck","livestock","agriculture"]}
