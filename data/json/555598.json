{"path":"555598.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph showcases a rugged terrain, primarily composed of eroded brown earth in the foreground. Several gullies with dark, muddy water can be seen cutting through the terrain, suggesting possible water flow or previous rainfall. This erosion dominates the lower half of the image, highlighting environmental degradation likely due to water movement.\n\nIn contrast, the upper half of the image features a mound covered with dark, perhaps coal-stained soil which appears relatively compact and less disturbed compared to the rest of the setting. The mound is noticeably blacker and seems to consist of a different material than the surrounding softer, brown soil.\n\nThe background is populated with lush greenery, including trees and shrubs, which introduce a stark, natural contrast to the disturbed earth in the forefront. The setting suggests a location possibly near a mining site or an area experiencing significant topographical stress from environmental factors.\n\nNo people or human activity are visible in the image; however, the erosion and contrasting soil types suggest human impact on the landscape, possibly related to industrial or agricultural activities. The overall mood of the photograph is a somber reflection on the impact of such activities on natural landscapes.","title":"Soil leached and discolored by dumped coal slag near Cadiz, Ohio","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["551231","545938","555610","545534","542612","552420","544751","554804","552994","550574","542863","554547","543817","545529","549119","555595"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["half","soil","mound","erosion","factor","gully","stress","earth","impact","coal"]}
