{"path":"557956.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a striking image of a vintage steam locomotive in action, billowing dark smoke against a backdrop of vivid blue sky accented by fluffy, white clouds. The locomotive, placed predominantly in the foreground on the left side of the image, exhibits classic design features characteristic of early 20th-century steam trains. These include a large, round smokestack, prominent cowcatcher, and distinctive metal details. The engineâ€™s dark body contrasts sharply with the bright highlights reflecting off its polished surfaces and its headlamp is lit, pointing forward.\n\nThe scene is further enriched by the presence of people close to the train tracks, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere. A group of passengers or perhaps train enthusiasts can be seen on the right-hand side of the frame, dressed in casual attire, gathered and appearing to watch or wait to board. Their presence injects a human element, suggesting the train might be either arriving or preparing for departure.\n\nThe setting appears to be semi-rural or possibly the outskirts of a town, indicated by a lush tree line in the backdrop that borders the sky. The ground near the tracks where people stand is gravelly, typical of railway environments.\n\nThe photograph exudes a nostalgic quality, capturing both the grandeur of historical rail transport and a slice of life from an era where train travel held a more prominent place in daily life. The composition smartly balances the mechanical prowess of the locomotive with the natural beauty of the environment and the human aspect of rail travel.","title":"Steam engine and train of the Cuyahoga Valley Line which operates weekends from the Cleveland, Ohio, zoo station to Ira Road through part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. The only way to see more of the recreation area is by canoeing the Cuyahoga River. Retired railroad employees work part-time on the system and the railroad provides free use of the tracks. Various groups in Cleveland and Akron have combined to sponsor the weekend excursions near Akron.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557963","557965","557967","557966","556022","556120","545541","549131","556857","557964","556100","557944","553621","556782","556106","556029"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","locomotive","rail","travel","steam","track","departure","headlamp","enthusiast","engine"]}
