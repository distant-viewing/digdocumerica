{"path":"554665.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people in a forested area during a daytime setting. It appears to be an educational or field research activity given the context of the image.\n\nForeground:\nIn the foreground, a person wearing a white shirt, bent over and apparently examining or collecting something, is partially visible on the left. Next to this individual, a group is engaged in discussion or observation.\n\nCentral Group:\nA central figure in a red and black plaid shirt stands out due to their bright garment and animated expression. There's a woman to this person's right (viewerâ€™s perspective) dressed in a red sweater and black pants, looking slightly towards another individual out of the central frame. Additionally, three more individuals are visible; one in a dark jacket looking at the central figure in plaid, another facing away in a denim jacket, and a third in a dark sweater.\n\nBackground and Setting:\nThe group is surrounded by trees with autumn foliage, mostly bare or with yellow leaves, indicating it might be fall. There are scattered leaves on the ground, blending yellow, green, and brown, which complement the natural, wooded ambiance of the setting. The natural daylight suggests a time either in late morning or early afternoon.\n\nOverall Composition:\nThe image suggests a moment of learning or investigation in a natural environment, with participants likely engaged in some form of environmental study or nature-related educational activity. The casual attire of the participants and the informal arrangement suggest a relaxed yet focused gathering, aimed at practical understanding or observation of the surroundings.","title":"Hikers consulting topographic maps in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Warrensburg (N.Y.)","location":"Warrensburg, New York","nn1":["557005","557007","545308","544003","551764","543236","553357","557006","554670","554662","544743","552944","543441","554672","544821","557206"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["participant","observation","sweater","plaid","group","investigation","learning","jacket","figure","garment"]}
