{"path":"545438.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This image captures a dramatic industrial landscape under a vibrant sunset. The sky presents rich hues of purple and orange, partially obscured by dark, heavy plumes of smoke rising into the air. The scene is backlit by the setting sun, which appears as a fiery orb partially visible at the horizon line, casting a warm glow across the surroundings.\n\nIn the foreground, the dark outlines of vegetation are slightly visible, indicating a vantage point from a grassy or bush-covered area. At a middle distance, an industrial complex dominates the view. Numerous tall, vertical structures, likely smokestacks or chimneys, prominently punctuate the skyline. These structures are silhouetted against the illuminated sky, enhancing their stark, imposing forms.\n\nThe smoke clouds emitted from the industrial facility are thick and expansive, indicating significant industrial activity, possibly related to manufacturing or energy production. The overall composition of the photograph, with its distinct contrast between natural beauty and industrial impact, offers a poignant commentary on environmental and industrial themes. It emphasizes the tension between industrial development and natural landscapes, capturing a moment of stunning visual contrast yet potential ecological concern.","title":"Continuous operation of steel plants gives Birmingham the red-orange nighttime glow.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["544708","545421","545425","545414","552156","548851","544684","553847","545418","546384","555166","545410","550821","547084","544173","551956"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["orb","smoke","tension","commentary","production","concern","purple","manufacturing","plume","energy"]}
