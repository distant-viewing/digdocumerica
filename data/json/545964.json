{"path":"545964.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of part of a modern, streamlined vehicle, specifically focusing on what appears to be the cockpit or front section. The main color scheme includes a vibrant red with a contrasting white. On the side of the vehicle, the word \"TRANSPORTATION\" is prominently displayed in large, bold, black letters on a white background.\n\nThe front of the vehicle has a rounded shape with windows that seem to wrap partially around its front, providing a wide field of vision. A distinctive logo, which includes a stylized bird in flight within a circle, is visible just behind the cockpit area. The bird logo is red with a white outline, matching the overall color theme.\n\nThe background is very minimal, featuring a clear and deep blue sky that suggests a bright, sunny day. This simplicity places all the attention on the vehicle itself. The ground beneath the vehicle is not clearly visible, indicating the photo was taken at a low angle, emphasizing the sleekness and design of the transportation vehicle.\n\nNo people are visible in the image, focusing entirely on the vehicle and its design.","title":"The LIMTV (linear induction motor test vehicle) is tested at the Dept. of Transportation's high speed ground test center.
