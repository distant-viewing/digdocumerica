{"path":"551015.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and colorful outdoor scene. In the foreground, a young toddler with short, light hair is lying on a set of large stone steps. The toddler is turned slightly towards the camera, dressed in a multicolored sleeveless top and light-colored bottoms, appearing relaxed and possibly tired as if resting.\n\nIn the background, an animated street band performs on the upper steps of what appears to be a large institutional or governmental building with grand architecture, including large columns and wide stone steps. The band consists of four members, each engaged actively in their performance. From left to right: a man in a red hat and dark clothing plays a trumpet, another man directly behind him on the drums, a man in the center with a saxophone, and a fourth man on the far right playing a trombone. All the musicians are dressed casually, and they present a dynamic and entertaining scene with some members seemingly in motion due to their performance.\n\nThe setting suggests a warm, sunny day, fitting for outdoor activities and music, contributing to an atmosphere of urban, cultural vibrancy. The combination of the resting child and the lively musicians offers a striking juxtaposition, highlighting two disparate yet coexisting aspects of public urban life.","title":"West Virginia celebrated its 100th birthday in 1973 with rock concerts on the steps of the state capitol.
