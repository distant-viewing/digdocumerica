{"path":"555934.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban street scene captured in a somewhat candid style. The composition is dominated by an out-of-focus figure in the foreground, a person with dark, shoulder-length hair wearing a black, skirt-like garment, and showing a bare back. The individual's identity is obscured as their back is to the camera.\n\nIn the background, across the street, there is another person clearly in focus, and actively engaged in an activity. This person is tossing a red Frisbee into the air. This individual appears to wear a black sleeveless top and dark pants. The background also includes dark-colored buildings with shop windows, some closed with metal shutters, suggesting a possibly quiet or rundown neighborhood. The street itself is devoid of any traffic, enhancing the isolated feel of the activity. The lighting in the image suggests it could be either dawn or dusk, given the soft light and long shadows present. \n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of playful spontaneity in an otherwise serene or desolate urban setting.","title":"Boys playing frisbee across West 46th Street in Manhattan, New York City. The inner city today is an absolute contradiction to the mainstream America of gas stations, expressways, shopping centers, and tract homes. It is populated by Blacks, Latins, and the white poor. Most of all, the inner city environment is human beings as beautiful and threatened as the 19th century buildings they inhabit.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["544849","549916","555930","551926","545404","545331","545400","553314","553822","555909","546642","545372","546646","557904","552763","551451"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["street","bare","person","spontaneity","identity","garment","shutter","skirt","shop","close"]}
