{"path":"545704.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures two hikers navigating a narrow canyon pathway. The canyon walls, towering on both sides, are rugged and textured, showcasing layers and striations of rock that suggest geological formations developed over millennia. The space between these towering cliffs is quite narrow, seemingly just a few feet across, filled with a sandy trail that forms the path the hikers are following.\n\nThe first hiker, located closer to the camera at the bottom of the image, is dressed in a red jacket and dark pants, wearing a helmet. This person is walking towards the camera and appears to be cautious in their steps. The second hiker, further along the path and towards the middle of the image, is also equipped with a backpack and possibly a helmet, dressed in lighter colored clothing, continuing along the trail away from the camera.\n\nThe lighting in the canyon is dim, with the walls casting deep shadows over much of the scene, which suggests the photo might have been taken at a time when the sun was not directly overhead. The overall atmosphere is one of adventure and exploration, with a touch of the claustrophobic confines of the narrow canyon space.","title":"Hiking through the Narrows on the Chesler Park trail","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["544301","545758","545705","544928","545772","544903","545693","544305","545697","545751","544895","545781","545768","545305","544931","545690"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["hiker","canyon","trail","helmet","camera","millennium","confine","path","striation","wall"]}
