{"path":"553179.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant night scene focused on an illuminated fountain, with a statue complex at its center, likely bronze, depicting multiple figures. The fountain’s lit water jets add a dynamic and enchanting element to the scene. There are multiple people gathered around the fountain, appearing as silhouettes against the bright lights of the water.\n\nIn the background, the architecture of stately buildings adds to the urban setting. One of the buildings is adorned with string lights along its columns, hinting at festive or decorative intention. A large electronic billboard above the fountain displays text, suggesting that the area may be commercial or a hub for social activity. The phrase \"YOUR NICEST MOTION\" is visible, possibly part of an advertisement or public message, alongside various names.\n\nThe overall ambiance is lively yet serene, emphasized by the artificial lighting against the night sky that dominates most of the photograph’s mood. The clarity of the night and the mixture of cultural and modern elements make the scene picturesque and full of character.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: Tyler Davidson Fountain.
