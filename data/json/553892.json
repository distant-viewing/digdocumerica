{"path":"553892.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of a large industrial facility, possibly a factory or plant, surrounded by spacious, well-maintained grassy areas. The main structure consists of several large buildings with flat roofs, connected together to form a cohesive complex. These buildings are predominantly dark in color, probably gray or black, with red accents visible on what appear to be vents or stacks protruding from the roofs.\n\nAdjacent to the factory buildings, there is a parking lot filled with numerous cars, indicative of either a shift change or a standard working day. The layout of the parking lot is organized, with clear markings and an ample number of spaces for vehicles.\n\nBeyond the immediate premises of the factory, the landscape opens up to flat fields stretching towards the horizon, with sparse vegetation. The scene is set under a clear blue sky, suggesting a bright, sunny day. A distant straight road can be seen cutting through the fields, emphasizing the vastness and the rural setting of the area around the plant.\n\nThe setting is industrial and functional, focused primarily on the large facility which dominates the photograph. There is no visible pollution or smoke, indicating that the operations might be relatively clean, or the picture was taken at a moment of low activity. The overall composition gives a sense of scale and the significant human effort involved in maintaining such a large industrial operation.","title":"Metal casting plant operating at full blast.
