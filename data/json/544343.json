{"path":"544343.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph presents a serene natural setting, capturing an individual swimming in a body of water with a picturesque waterfall in the background. The waterfall is multi-tiered, cascading over rocky outcrops covered with lush vegetation, and flows into the tranquil pool where the person is seen. The swimmer's head is visible above the water, looking directly at the camera with a calm expression.\n\nThe forefront of the image shows the calm, reflective waters of the pool, hinting at the quiet and secluded nature of this natural setting. A rocky red cliff forms one side of the waterfall, suggesting that this scene might be located in a region with red rock geology, possibly resembling landscapes found in parts of the American Southwest.\n\nThe left side of the photograph partially displays a reflection, possibly from a curved metallic object, adding a hint of human presence or activity beyond the immediate focus on the swimmer and nature.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes a feeling of peaceful coexistence with nature, inviting the viewer to appreciate the beauty and tranquility of this secluded spot. The lighting, likely from the sun, enhances the vivid colors of the rocks and vegetation, adding depth and warmth to the scene.","title":"Bather cools off at Havasu Falls.
