{"path":"545029.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a slick, muddy terrain interspersed with several puddles reflecting light. The setting appears to be an outdoor area partially illuminated, possibly during the early morning or late evening given the soft, dim lighting. Prominently visible across the frame are three old tires partially embedded or lying on the surface of this muddy ground. The terrain is uneven and has a patchy appearance with numerous tufts of grass and other small, dark, rounded formations, potentially small stones or clumps of mud, distributed irregularly throughout.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of desolation and neglect. The murky colors and wet ground suggest a recent rainfall or a location near a watery area. The lighting condition creates a somewhat somber mood, emphasizing a sense of abandonment. The photograph lacks any human presence or active engagement, focusing solely on the interaction between these discarded objects and the natural environment.","title":"Siltcoos Lake","placename":"Siltcoos Lake (Or.)","location":"Siltcoos Lake, Oregon","nn1":["546913","547689","547590","555521","546838","547979","555871","552102","547517","555882","547024","547527","545294","553866","546920","544060"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["tuft","embed","clump","distribute","puddle","rainfall","mud","desolation","tire","terrain"]}
