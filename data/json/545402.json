{"path":"545402.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and moody scene of a highway at sunset. Dominating the image is a large, orange sun hanging centrally in the sky above the horizon, casting an ambient, warm glow throughout the scene. Below the sun, the highway stretches straight into the distance, flanked on both sides by dense rows of trees, which appear silhouetted against the sunset. The road itself is dotted with cars, their headlights creating small points of light that lead the viewer's eye down the path of the highway. \n\nThe atmosphere of the photograph is hazy, adding a sense of depth and mystique. This, combined with the natural gradient of colors in the sky—from dark orange near the sun to deeper reds and purples towards the edges—creates a visually rich tableau. The overall impression is that of a quiet moment on an evening drive, evoking feelings of calm and introspection. The photograph has a grainy texture, which along with the presence of slight scratches and imperfections on the image, lends it a vintage, timeless quality.","title":"Red-orange smoke of the steel plants gives Birmingham its dramatic night time look","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["552596","545352","549140","543410","545432","545349","542678","543146","549002","544009","557957","549106","545367","543024","545886","546401"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["highway","sun","sunset","mystique","imperfection","scratch","introspection","tableau","headlight","drive"]}
