{"path":"546920.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an environmental scene characterized by pollution. The central focus is on a muddy area soaked with what appears to be oil or a similar dark, viscous liquid, suggesting chemical contamination. Prominently featured in the scene is a discarded white can, label indistinct, lying on its side in the polluted black muck, symbolizing human negligence towards natural environments.\n\nAround this central object, the environment is bleak and supports the theme of neglect: scattered branches, twigs, and leaves are half-submerged in the oily mud, all coated with a sheen that reflects some degree of light, indicating the presence of a liquid contaminant. The general tone of the photograph is dark and lacks vibrant colors, emphasizing the degradation and the absence of life typically found in a healthy natural setting.\n\nThe background is less distinct, cloaked in shadows and blended dark tones of the trees and bushes which obscure any specific details. This bleak, dirtied natural scene speaks volumes about issues of environmental pollution and the impact of human activity on natural landscapes. The composition and coloring enhance the grim reality of environmental degradation.","title":"After a spill of 4000 gallons of oil, workers have placed booms across stony run to contain the oil, and a special material to soak it up","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["550812","550352","544580","556942","544810","543614","550806","551440","547524","543302","551247","547907","551561","543762","551560","546838"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["degradation","pollution","cloak","soak","contamination","degree","coloring","reality","volume","symbolize"]}
