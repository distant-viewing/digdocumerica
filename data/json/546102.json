{"path":"546102.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a serene pastoral scene likely taken in a rural setting. The foreground shows a field of tall, golden-brown grass, amidst which several cattle are grazing. The cattle, appearing in various shades of brown and black, are scattered across the middle part of the image, adding a peaceful, bucolic quality to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, just off-center to the left, there is a clump of dead, bleached-out wood, resembling either a small pile of logs or branches. This detail adds a natural, rustic element to the scene, suggesting either past human activity or natural decay.\n\nThe background features gently rolling hills, which are dotted with sporadic trees and shrubs, primarily in shades of green, indicating a mix of foliage perhaps typical of a temperate climate zone. The trees are not densely packed, but rather sporadically placed, which allows for open spaces and clearings visible in the midground and background.\n\nOn the left side of the background, there is a slope with denser vegetation, including trees that are thicker and possibly older, suggesting a bordering woodland. Halfway up the hill in the background, there appears to be a simple fence, perhaps indicating the boundaries of different property areas or serving as a measure to contain the livestock.\n\nFurther in the distance, there is a structure that appears to be a small building or shed, adding a human element to the otherwise natural landscape. This structure is surrounded by thinner vegetation, providing a contrast with the denser areas around it.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, the lighting, and the distribution of elements—animals, vegetation, and human-made structures—suggest a peaceful, rural environment, possibly on a farm or in a nature reserve. The photograph might evoke themes of agriculture, nature conservation, or the rustic beauty of pastoral life.","title":"Buffalo herd on bell ranch","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["550833","542626","555645","557747","557749","542627","542622","545153","549156","554560","549142","545040","542628","555635","555577","554071"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["cattle","denser","bleach","pastoral","clump","reserve","distribution","vegetation","graze","measure"]}
