{"path":"550632.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning aerial view of a rugged, mountainous landscape. The image is densely packed with natural features, highlighting the dramatic terrains typically seen in regions like Alaska or similar northern wildernesses. In the center of the photograph, a sizable glacier extends from the shadowed peaks of the sharp, snow-covered mountains toward the valley below, where its ice has given way to a braided river system. These silvery river channels are wide and meander through the valley, surrounded by dense green forest on either side. The terrain is wild and untouched, with no visible signs of human habitation or infrastructure, emphasizing the pristine and isolated nature of this environment. The lighting suggests it might be either dawn or dusk, as the shadows are long, and the overall tone of the photograph is somewhat dim, adding to the moody and majestic ambiance of this wilderness scene.","title":"A view west up the Tsina River Valley toward Ptarmigan Drop. The Worthington Glacier appears in the distance. Here, the pipeline will run up the Tsina Valley on a straight alignment before turning 90ยบ left and running due south between the snout of the receding Worthington Glacier and the Richardson Highway.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555663","550507","550522","550590","550410","550595","550594","550523","555678","550635","550402","550418","550401","550636","555669","550518"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["valley","wilderness","glacier","ice","channel","river","habitation","terrain","way","dawn"]}
