{"path":"555886.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged, rocky terrain covered in dark volcanic soil or ash. Sparse vegetation, primarily small cacti, dot the landscape. The cacti are quite small, suggesting a harsh, arid environment where it is hard for plants to thrive. There are several young cacti with bright green bodies and prominent spines clearly visible against the darker ground. The background is out of focus, emphasizing the small cacti in the foreground.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it is taken during a time of day when the sun is bright, casting sharp shadows on the ground that highlight the textured surface of the soil, composed of various-sized rocks and pebbles. There are no human activities or any animals visible in the image; it conveys a sense of isolation and untouched natural landscape, typical of volcanic or desert regions. \n\nThe overall composition focuses on the interplay of light and texture, emphasizing the adaptation of life forms in a seemingly inhospitable environment. The color palette is dominated by earth tones that range from black and dark gray to hints of green from the cacti, conveying a stark yet resilient natural world.","title":"Some cactus survived the sludge application at the disposal site.  About 1,200,000 gallons of acid water and oil were treated and spread over the area, then mixed with earth.  The site was to be monitored for a year under an agreement between epa, which supervised the pond cleanup, and Utah state university","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["545724","555029","555885","552428","544440","544921","543635","555573","552444","549183","555642","545797","549132","554140","550442","544401"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["cacto","volcanic","ash","spine","soil","det","adaptation","pebble","thrive","world"]}
