{"path":"542941.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a bustling industrial logging and wood processing facility. The image is richly detailed and vividly colored, showing various elements of the operation.\n\nForeground:\nThe scene is dominated by a large body of deep blue water on the left, peppered with numerous floating wood logs organized neatly in rows. These log booms are likely being prepared for processing. On the shore closest to the water, there are piles of logs and wood debris, indicating active logging and sorting operations.\n\nMiddle ground:\nA cluster of industrial buildings, most likely processing mills or storage facilities, occupies the central area of the photograph. These buildings have large metal roofs, some showing signs of rust and wear, hinting at the industrial nature and possibly the age of the facility. Several vehicles, including trucks and forklifts, are visible around these buildings, suggesting ongoing operations.\n\nRight side:\nProminent on this side is a large sawdust burner, a conical structure from which smoke and steam are billowing, venting byproducts from the wood milling process. The presence of this burner highlights the facilityâ€™s reliance on wood as a primary resource and the need to manage waste products efficiently.\n\nBackground:\nBeyond the immediate industrial area, the landscape features dense forest, reinforcing the location's woodland setting, which is typical for such industries. The smoke suggests active forest management and resource extraction activities.\n\nComposition:\nThe overall composition of the photograph is dynamic and well-balanced between natural landscapes and human industrial activity, emphasizing the interaction between nature and technology in resource management. The aerial perspective provides a comprehensive view of the operation's scale and its environmental setting.","title":"Lumbermill","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545011","542945","542944","542940","542942","552140","552162","542921","542946","550349","551578","546236","545260","542933","545256","555165"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["wood","burner","resource","log","processing","operation","facility","logging","management","byproduct"]}
