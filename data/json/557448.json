{"path":"557448.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a serene natural scene during what appears to be dusk or dawn. It features a single bird silhouetted against a textured water surface bathed in vibrant reddish-orange hues, suggesting the colors of sunrise or sunset. The bird, likely a type of wading bird given its long legs and elongated beak, stands in the shallow water that reflects the warm sky colors in varied shades of orange and dark red, interspersed with ripples and shadows. The calm surrounding and the reflection of the bird on the water add to the peaceful composition of the photograph. There are no visible structures or other distractions in the background, which directs the focus solely on the interaction of natural light and the graceful posture of the bird in this tranquil setting.","title":"Shorebird wading in Upper Newport Bay, near Newport Beach. The bay, scheduled for development as a yacht harbor, is an excellent example of a bird refuge. The state's coastal waters and lands provide a habitat for more than 108 species and subspecies of mammals, 260 birds, 54 reptiles and amphibians, and a wide variety of fish. Since 1900, coastal wetlands needed for their survival have decreased from 381,000 to 125,000 acres.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["543063","548832","557495","553777","550388","547726","543922","543918","544539","553776","547744","554069","545991","551379","542992","545142"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","beak","distraction","wade","sunrise","leg","bathe","dawn","direct","orange"]}
