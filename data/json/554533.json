{"path":"554533.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene mountainous vista, set under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a young woman with long hair, wearing a denim jacket and dark pants, is crouched beside a small, shallow pool of water on a rocky terrain. She seems to be touching the water or interacting with something in the pool, her reflection visible on the surface.\n\nThe background features a breathtaking panoramic view of a mountain range covered with lush green foliage. The mountains rise majestically under the wide sky, creating an atmosphere of peacefulness and grandeur. The valley between the observer and the mountains is dotted with lighter patches, possibly fields or meadows, and the texture of the distant forest appears soft due to the distance.\n\nThis composition provides a sense of scale and isolation, emphasizing the vastness of the natural landscape compared to the solitary figure of the woman. The sharpness and clarity of the foreground contrast with the hazier, softer hues of the distant mountains, directing focus towards the human element within this expansive environment.","title":"Small tarn (pool of water) atop an outcropping of rock near the summit of Algonquin Mountain in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York State.
