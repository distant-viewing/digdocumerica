{"path":"554256.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph depicts a winter rescue operation on a snowy hillside. There are four individuals involved, dressed in ski gear. Three of them are wearing red jackets with a cross emblem, indicating they are part of a rescue team, and one is in a blue jacket. The rescue team members are attending to someone covered by a yellow tarp on a sled designed for snow rescue, suggesting that this is a ski accident victim.\n\nOne rescuer, closest to the camera, is kneeling beside some ski equipment and a red backpack, possibly organizing medical supplies or emergency equipment. Another rescuer is attending directly to the person under the yellow tarp, possibly checking their condition or securing them onto the sled. The third rescuer appears to be handling the sled, preparing for evacuation. The individual in the blue jacket is crouched near the front of the sled, possibly assisting in readying the sled for movement or providing additional help.\n\nSurrounding this scene are scattered skis, ski poles, and small pine trees, indicating a well-used ski area. The ground is covered with thick snow and the environment suggests a serene yet urgent atmosphere, typical of ski rescue operations. The focus of the crew and their arrangements around the sled display a well-coordinated emergency response effort.","title":"Ski patrol attends an injured skier.
