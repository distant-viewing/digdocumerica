{"path":"545347.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph presents a dramatic and rustic landscape scene taken during twilight. In the foreground, the composition starts with a rough, texturized terrain. This leads to a dark roadway that cuts horizontally across the image, and could be a road or railway due to its smooth and linear quality, bordered by small rocks and patches of grass.\n\nBeyond the roadway, the scene opens up into an expansive flat field covered with wild grass, stretching towards a large mountain range in the middle ground. The mountains exhibit deep purple and brown hues, likely accentuated by the low sunlight of either sunrise or sunset, casting long shadows and creating a play of light and dark across the rugged surface.\n\nThe background features a clear sky that gradiently transitions from a soft purple at the top to a deeper tone near the horizon. Notably, a full moon hangs above the mountains, adding a sense of calm and stillness to the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image captures a sense of isolation and the vastness of nature, emphasized by the wide-open spaces and the limited signs of human presence. The lighting suggests the image was captured during the magical hour of dusk, adding a layer of warmth and mystery to the landscape.","title":"Rio rancho estates subdivision","placename":"Albuquerque (N.M.)","location":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","nn1":["557575","557558","543023","544870","542681","553975","552927","544123","554644","550429","555378","549140","555131","553569","543712","544116"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["roadway","mountain","moon","start","mystery","warmth","grass","sunrise","open","purple"]}
