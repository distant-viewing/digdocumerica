{"path":"551226.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an environmental scene featuring two people and a mix of industrial debris in a waterlogged area. The image is dominated by multiple large cylindrical objects, both metallic and white styrofoam. The metallic cylinders, likely old barrels, appear rusted and battered, floating and half-submerged in murky brown water. The white styrofoam cylinders are also bobbing in the water but appear cleaner and in better condition.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a young man with a slender build and no shirt is seen interacting with one of the white styrofoam cylinders. He is bending over the object, reaching out with both hands as if attempting to move or stabilize it. His focus is directed towards the object, and his engagement suggests he is likely trying to manage or clean up the area.\n\nOn the left side, partially obscured by the barrels and foam, another individual is visible. This person appears to be a child or adolescent, also not wearing a shirt, engaging with the barrels in the water. This individual seems to be moving through the water, navigating between the clutter of debris.\n\nThe backdrop of the scene is less defined, hinting at a natural, muddy shoreline that blends into a non-descript area, possibly a neglected or industrial site. The overall atmosphere is one of disorder and pollution, with a touch of human effort directed towards managing the situation, possibly for environmental clean-up purposes.","title":"Workers at Port Arrowhead Marina are replacing old flotation Barrels with the required Styrofoam Barrels. Aim is to eliminate oil and chemicals leakage that came from old Barrels. Fear is that Styrofoam will chip with wear and leave a non-biodegradable floating mess.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["545663","552085","555867","554534","555852","553045","557243","554535","544810","550812","546892","552127","547907","547626","551529","557238"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["cylinder","barrel","object","disorder","clutter","build","situation","debris","foam","water"]}
