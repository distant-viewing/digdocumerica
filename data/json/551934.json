{"path":"551934.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a touching moment in an outdoor setting. It features three individuals, with a focus on a man and a woman embracing in the center. The man, wearing a white shirt, plaid pants and a wide-brimmed hat, is bending slightly to hug the woman. The woman is dressed in a white and peach outfit with a plaid pattern on her trousers, suggesting a coordination with the manâ€™s attire. She's holding a large bag that appears to contain items, possibly from a day out or a picnic.\n\nAt their side, a young girl, possibly their daughter, stands looking away from the camera. She is wearing a white dress with large, dark polka dots and red shoes. Her attention is drawn to something outside the frame, adding a sense of casual, everyday life to the moment.\n\nThe background consists of lush green trees and a simple white wooden fence, enhancing the serene, park-like setting. The asphalt pathway on which they stand adds to the public, outdoor environment of the shot. The overall composition and the attire of the individuals suggest a warm, summery day, and the photograph exudes a feeling of affection and family bonding.","title":"Comforting a member of the family at Lincoln Park outing","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551027","556235","556531","556525","547398","558187","547135","543863","556561","556092","547391","547072","543040","549922","557933","544230"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["plaid","bonding","woman","affection","coordination","polka","picnic","dot","asphalt","attire"]}
