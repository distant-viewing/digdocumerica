{"path":"554170.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph appears to be an aerial view of a coastal area, possibly captured from an airplane. The composition of the image shows a mix of natural landscapes and water bodies. To the left and upper section of the image, there's a sinuous road that curves through a region with dark soil, possibly volcanic, dotted with sparse green vegetation. This road divides the landscape and leads along the coastline.\n\nThe coast itself features several sandy beaches, particularly notable at the center of the image where a golden sandy beach hugs the curve of a bay. The water adjacent to these beaches is a light, translucent turquoise, indicating shallow waters. Further into the ocean, the water transitions into a darker blue, suggesting increasing depth.\n\nThe right and lower part of the image is dominated by the vast ocean with visible white wave crests, indicating some wind or currents affecting this part of the sea.\n\nThe background, beyond the coastline and roads, appears to be a mix of different terrains including darker areas that might be lava fields and patches of greenery which could be forested or agricultural land.\n\nVisually, this photograph captures a stunning interaction between land and sea, highlighting a diverse and potentially volcanic landscape. There are no people or moving vehicles visible in the image, which emphasizes the natural scenic beauty and tranquility of the area.","title":"Shoreline of area near Kamuela which has been rezoned for urban use in the most recent controversial land speculation case","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554171","543429","548785","553774","554023","554156","543328","548604","543435","543424","553983","543088","554090","543430","543425","554052"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["beach","coastline","ocean","lava","turquoise","road","sea","curve","hug","increase"]}
