{"path":"552191.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph showcases an aerial view of an industrial area located along a waterfront. The structures and objects include a range of factory buildings, storage warehouses, and processing plants, most of which are in various shades of grey and green. Visible within the industrial complex are several large cylindrical tanks, some possibly for storage of chemicals or raw materials, along with other smaller tanks. Piles of yellowish raw material (likely wood chips or sawdust) can be seen accumulated in open storage areas.\n\nThe area in the foreground features a dock with boats or barges, indicating the facilities may involve shipping or handling materials via water. In addition, wooden crates or pallets are organized in rows next to these docks.\n\nTowards the background, adjacent to the industrial buildings, a community of residential houses is visible. These homes have typical slanted roofs and appear nestled amongst tree-lined streets, creating a stark contrast between the compact, densely populated industrial site and the more sparsely populated residential area.\n\nSmoke or steam is emerging from several stacks, suggesting ongoing industrial processes. The water body adjacent to the facilities reflects a serene image in contrast to the bustling activity of the industrial site.\n\nOverall, the composition strikingly juxtaposes industrial activity with residential life, highlighting how such facilities can dominate a landscape, both visually and functionally.","title":"Pulping waste from ITT Rayonier sulphite mill discolors the water","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548423","549495","551566","550890","550886","549511","555769","548340","555776","552181","552187","551998","551183","555165","551995","552209"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["storage","facility","material","sawdust","dock","tank","pallet","site","crate","accumulate"]}
