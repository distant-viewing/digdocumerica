{"path":"545008.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a serene natural scene dominated by a water body, possibly a river or marsh, with a rich display of vibrant greenery and a distant landscape. On the right side of the frame, the foreground is taken up by two weathered, cylindrical wooden posts tied together with a frayed rope, partially submerged in the clear water. These posts appear to be part of a disused or makeshift dock structure, as pieces of weathered wood boards can also be seen connected to it.\n\nThe middle ground is densely filled with tall, lush green grasses or reeds, indicating a wetland ecosystem. The water is calm, reflecting light and contributing to the peacefulness of the scene. \n\nIn the background, the perspective opens up to a broader view of the waterway, which narrows as it meanders into the distance. A patch of similar tall grasses runs parallel on the other side of the water, while further away, there appears to be a land mass or hill characterized by clusters of trees or dense vegetation. The sky, visible at the upper part of the image, is slightly overexposed suggesting a bright sunny day, which enhances the overall vividness of the natural colors in the scene. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, which includes natural elements, water reflections, and the subtle detail of decayed man-made structures, portrays a quiet, untouched stretch of a wetland environment, evoking a sense of tranquility and the passage of time.","title":"Sewer outfall still flows into the Columbia River at Ilwaco.
