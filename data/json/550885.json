{"path":"550885.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a large river with multiple visual textures and colors. The river's expanse fills the majority of the image, displaying variations in color—from dark brown to a lighter, muddy tan—likely indicating different depths, currents, or sediment types. The surrounding land areas show dense, green foliage on both banks which suggests a heavily wooded region, possibly near a marsh or wetland, as indicated by the presence of patches of green floating vegetation on the water's surface near the left and middle parts of the image.\n\nThe photograph's composition emphasizes the contrast between the smooth surface of water and the more textured, lush landscapes on the riverbanks. A few small buildings can be seen tucked among the trees in the lower left quadrant, adjacent to a dirt road, portraying human habitation or recreational usage of the region. No people are visibly present in the scene, emphasizing the area's natural and somewhat remote characteristics. The overall feel is one of serene isolation, focusing on nature’s expansive and quiet beauty, disturbed only minimally by human structures.","title":"Algae collects in side bay of the Fox River between Appleton and Green Bay.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552838","550623","550542","553452","550392","550527","550622","555753","556964","552953","546351","550524","550580","549456","550581","547227"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["quadrant","disturb","region","marsh","tuck","majority","characteristic","usage","current","river"]}
