{"path":"552557.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene winter landscape, likely taken in a rural or mountainous area, covered in snow. The scene is dominated by a snow-clad field in the foreground, with horses scattered across the landscape, grazing or wandering freely. The middle ground of the photograph features several wooden structures—likely barns or rural homes—interspersed with fenced areas that appear to be pens or paddocks for livestock.\n\nA group of sheep, clustered together possibly for warmth, are visible in the middle of the field. This suggests some form of pastoral activity, possibly sheep farming, taking place despite the snow.\n\nIn the background, steep hills or low mountains, also blanketed in snow, enclose the scene, contributing to a feeling of isolation and tranquility. The overall ambiance is peaceful, with the snowy landscape muffling the usual sounds of rural life. The composition of the photograph, with animals in their natural habitats and rustic buildings, showcases a typical winter day in a countryside setting.","title":"Sheep and cattle ranching is the chief occupation of the Piceance basin. The large ranches are based on private lands in the valley bottoms.
