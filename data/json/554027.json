{"path":"554027.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant rural landscape featuring a mix of agricultural fields and natural scenery. In the foreground, clusters of dense shrubbery dotted with red flowers, possibly berries, create a vivid contrast against the background. The flora looks lush, hinting at a healthy natural environment.\n\nMoving towards the middle ground, structured and neatly partitioned agricultural fields dominate the view. These fields, exhibiting varying shades of green, are meticulously arranged in rectangular and trapezoidal shapes, indicating a highly organized farming system. A curved dirt road bisects these fields, leading towards a water body on the left side.\n\nThe water body, possibly a lake or a large pond, rests calmly adjacent to the fields, its surface reflecting the light sky above. Its banks are mostly barren compared to the green fields, showing a stark earthy brown color. The water's proximity to the fields suggests it might play a crucial role in irrigation.\n\nIn the background, the terrain gently rises into rolling hills, which gradually blend into a cloudy sky speckled with both white and darker clouds, suggesting variability in the weather. These hills appear less cultivated and more natural, possibly grazing lands or fallow fields, adding a sense of depth and diversity to the rural landscape.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a harmonious coexistence of agriculture and natural elements within a vast, open countryside, under a dynamic sky that adds a dramatic element to the serene landscape.","title":"Kualapuu Reservoir, built to capture heavy rainfall on \"wet\" side of island, is important to Molokai's agriculture.
