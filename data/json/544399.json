{"path":"544399.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph features a vintage light blue pickup truck with a large flatbed. On the flatbed, there are two horses secured with harnesses. The truck appears to be parked or moving slowly on a street. Behind the truck, there is a rustic wooden building with a sign that reads \"Margaret Kilgore's Indian Arts and Crafts\" and advertises products such as rugs, sundries, and Indian jewelry. Additionally, in the background, a tall sign with the word \"Chevron\" stands prominently, indicating a gas station nearby. There are other vehicles visible in the area, including a car to the right of the frame. The setting suggests a small town street scene, possibly in a region associated with Native American art and crafts. The overall ambiance of the photo evokes a mid-20th century American townscape.","title":"Arizona--Moenkopi","placename":"Moenkopi (Ariz.)","location":"Moenkopi, Arizona","nn1":["544370","544395","542803","544425","544329","551070","553114","557050","550087","550005","548980","544767","555817","557716","545618","554879"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["flatbed","truck","jewelry","harness","pickup","advertise","art","street","secure","craft"]}
