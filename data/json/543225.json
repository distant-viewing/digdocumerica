{"path":"543225.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and playful moment at a beach setting. In the foreground, three individuals appear to be engaged in a beach activity near the shoreline. The person on the left is bending over, possibly picking up shells or adjusting something on the sandy ground, supported by what looks like a small shovel. They are dressed in a light-colored long-sleeve shirt and red pants. In the middle, another individual, wearing a dark turtleneck and jeans, is assisting or participating in the activity. On the right, a child is standing and observing, wearing a red outfit.\n\nThe beach is characterized by wet sand, indicating the tide might be low, and the waves gently approach the shore in a quiet lapping fashion. The sunlight casts bright reflections on the water, suggesting a sunny day with clear skies.\n\nIn the background, a pier extends into the sea, with its dark, vertical structures contrasting against the bright shimmer of the ocean. This provides a sense of depth and context for the beach setting, hinting at a public or well-visited coastal area. The sharp detail and vivid colors in the photo suggest it might have been taken during the midday when the sun is at its highest. The overall atmosphere is one of peaceful engagement with nature and leisure activity at the beach.","title":"California--Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["547009","547877","555402","557511","552341","557507","548697","555892","543072","547676","546982","543493","555923","545162","543216","544291"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","turtleneck","shimmer","shovel","shell","tide","midday","pier","fashion","engagement"]}
