{"path":"543387.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a line of hikers trekking along a narrow trail in a scenic mountainous terrain. The terrain is characterized by dense vegetation, featuring a mix of colorful foliage possibly indicative of autumn. The hikers, who are wearing backpacks and outdoor clothing suitable for hiking, are moving towards majestic rugged peaks visible in the distance. The peaks have steep rocky faces and sharp edges, looming dramatically over the landscape. Light appears to be shining from a direction that places the mountains partially in shadow and highlights the trail and the hikers, creating a vivid contrast between the illuminated and shaded areas. The atmosphere suggests a crisp, clear day, ideal for hiking and appreciating the surrounding natural beauty.","title":"Back - packing expedition of explorer post 397 of Los Angeles area","placename":"Monarch Lakes (Calif.)","location":"Monarch Lakes, California","nn1":["543381","543388","554558","543382","554508","544305","554503","543385","545700","543510","554504","554505","554509","554663","545751","545772"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiker","trail","peak","shine","appreciate","hiking","illuminated","hike","shaded","loom"]}
