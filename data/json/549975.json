{"path":"549975.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This image captures an aerial view of an industrial area with a distinct focus on a substantial number of storage tanks. It features a dense arrangement of cylindrical storage tanks, predominantly white with what appear to be gray or silver tops. These tanks are organized in rows, which creates a patterned visual effect amidst the industrial environment.\n\nIn addition to the storage tanks, the photograph shows multiple roads and a major highway running vertically through the scene, filled with vehicles suggesting moderate to heavy traffic. This highway is elevated, with access ramps connecting it to the ground level, where various smaller vehicles and industrial structures can be seen.\n\nDirt areas, some containing heaps of materials such as coal or scrap, are spread around the tanks, and several patches of greenery are visible, suggesting small grassy areas amidst the industrial setup. The backdrop reveals an expansive industrial landscape, possibly including more factories and industrial structures stretching towards a horizon obscured by haze or pollution.\n\nThe color tones in the image are largely subdued with a dominance of earthy browns, grays, and the faded whites of the tanks, lending an overall gritty and industrial feel to the photograph. The atmosphere is somewhat obscured, likely due to industrial emissions or fog, which casts a veil over the scene, washing out the distant details and sky.","title":"Gulf and Arco plants--","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["549977","549978","555777","546108","552025","542587","555754","549960","552009","555778","555774","551987","555775","546221","545273","551995"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["tank","storage","highway","veil","dominance","ramp","addition","scrap","coal","heap"]}
