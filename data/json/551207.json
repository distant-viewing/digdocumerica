{"path":"551207.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and tranquil atmosphere. The composition centers on a rugged, cliff-like shoreline with a prominent tree, possibly a pine, growing at an angle from the rocky terrain. The tree's branches extend dynamically towards the sky, creating a natural frame that contrasts with the smooth surface of the water below.\n\nThe lake itself is vast, with its calm waters reflecting a gentle blue hue indicative of a clear day. On the lake, a small boat is visible, creating a gentle wake as it moves through the water, suggesting leisure activity such as boating or fishing. In the background, dense forest on an opposite shore fills the horizon, adding a rich deep green to the landscape and enhancing the sense of seclusion and natural beauty.\n\nThe overall feel of the image is peaceful, highlighting the quiet and beauty of a natural lake environment, ideal for reflection or peaceful outdoor activities.","title":"Main Osage Arm of Lake of the Ozarks at Horseshoe Bend.
