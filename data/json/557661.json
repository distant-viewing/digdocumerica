{"path":"557661.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a daytime street scene that appears to be in a rural or semi-rural area. There are several notable features:\n\n1. **Buildings**: On the right, there's a large building with a distinctive Alpine or Tudor-style architecture, featuring a steeply pitched roof and decorative half-timbering (exposed wood framing with white plaster or similar material between). This building has a prominent sign that reads \"Howard Johnson's,\" indicating it might be a restaurant or motel, typical of the chain known for such services.\n\n2. **Other Structures**: Next to the Howard Johnson's, there is a small structure with a white exterior and a conical roof, resembling a small tower or kiosk. Adjacent to this, there appears to be a series of smaller, possibly temporary, buildings or stalls that could be used for various commercial or storage purposes.\n\n3. **Vehicles**: There are several cars visible in the image, reflecting styles typical of the late 1960s to 1970s judging by their design. A blue sedan is parked near the forefront, and other vehicles are visible in the parking areas and on the street. These provide a sense of the era and the functional use of the area.\n\n4. **Road and Infrastructure**: The road is a two-lane street, with visible street markings. At the forefront, there's a curved curb and a yellow-lined no-parking zone near to where the photograph is taken, likely indicating either a street corner or a driveway. There is also a sidewalk bordering the street.\n\n5. **Natural Landscape**: Behind the buildings, there are wooded hills, suggesting the location is either in a valley or surrounded by forested areas. The trees look lush and green, indicative of either late spring or summer.\n\n6. **General Atmosphere**: The overall setting feels like a travel route spot, possibly a popular stop for travelers given the existence of the Howard Johnson's, which were well-known for catering to road-trippers during the mid-20th century in the United States.\n\nThe entire scene captured gives an impression of a quiet, possibly early morning or late afternoon, with business operations seeming calm, possibly just beginning or winding down for the day.","title":"Quarter acre plot of land surrounding the Wurst Haus (restaurant in left background) in Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. The land was sold to several independent developers for $200,000. Construction of a commercial complex of shops and restaurants will begin as soon as the village sewage treatment system is completed. Once the sewage plant is in operation the land development must be completed within two years. The photo was taken from the main street water fountain.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["558037","549224","544882","551071","556766","554709","545610","552526","557655","557155","557660","558038","555584","558028","545618","545614"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","know","forefront","parking","existence","plaster","kiosk","motel","building","cater"]}
