{"path":"543389.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and dynamic coastal scene. In the foreground, a patch of succulent plants with bright yellow flowers adds a splash of color. The middle ground features a beach with a cluster of people engaged in various activitiesâ€”some are walking along the rugged, rocky paths, while others are congregated on the sandy shore. The composition suggests a casual, leisurely atmosphere as the individuals, dressed in casual outdoor clothing, explore and interact with one another.\n\nThe landscape is characterized by sharply eroded cliffs, which drop off to the beach and continue into the scene with rocky outcroppings jutting into the sea. The ocean is visible in the background, its waters churned up into white froth against the rocks, hinting at a brisk breeze. The sky is overcast, casting a soft diffused light over the entire scene, which enhances the natural, untouched feel of the setting.\n\nThis setting evokes a sense of adventure and exploration, with the raw beauty of nature dominating the scene and providing an idyllic backdrop for human activity. The image captures a moment of harmony between humans and the rugged coastal landscape, inviting viewers to reflect on the serene and unspoiled environment.","title":"'Flowers along Swanton Road'","placename":"Pebble Beach (Calif.)","location":"Pebble Beach, California","nn1":["543204","543193","547592","543401","543399","547697","543404","553765","543492","543297","542917","543289","543192","545122","543310","543188"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["outcropping","beach","froth","harmony","breeze","splash","adventure","cliff","exploration","ocean"]}
