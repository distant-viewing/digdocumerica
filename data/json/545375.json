{"path":"545375.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph features a striking natural scene under a dramatic sky. In the upper section, the sky is partially filled with large, billowing clouds that are both dark and illuminated from behind, producing a dynamic contrast. Sunbeams radiate out from behind the clouds, casting diffused light that highlights portions of the clouds and creates an ethereal backlighting effect.\n\nBelow this dramatic sky, the landscape seems rugged and somewhat desolate. The scene is underlit, making it appear mostly in silhouette which limits the detail but suggests a terrain of irregular, rocky ground stretching into the distance. The arrangement appears natural and untouched, with a dense line of trees or a forest visible along the horizon, forming a dark profile against the sky.\n\nThe composition creates a sense of solitude and untouched nature, emphasizing the powerful and inspiring beauty of the natural world, particularly within the interplay of light and clouds in the sky.","title":"Strip-mined landscape near Route 269","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["552483","547356","543712","547352","544944","550390","557591","545907","557575","550604","547793","553993","544905","548673","550391","544123"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["cloud","backlighting","limit","radiate","produce","world","profile","billow","sky","diffuse"]}
