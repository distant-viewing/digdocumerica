{"path":"554582.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a pink lady's slipper orchid (Cypripedium acaule), commonly found in woodland settings. The orchid is a distinct and delicate flower characterized by its unique slipper-shaped pouch, which is prominent in the image. This pouch is a dusty pink color, with a slight velvety texture visible on the surface, and highlighted by a deeper pink vein structure. The slipper is open, revealing its inner parts, and is accompanied by a thin, elongated petal or sepal that rises vertically in a curving manner above the pouch.\n\nThe stem of the flower is thin and green, supporting the weight of the flower itself, and is surrounded by a few sparse green leaves which add contrasting color and texture against the smooth, detailed petals. The foreground focuses sharply on the flower, while the background fades into a soft, blurred fusion of greens and earth tones, suggesting a natural, undisturbed habitat typical of this plant species.\n\nThe lighting in the image is soft and appears natural, illuminating the flower gently which enhances the textures and colors of the orchid, giving a serene and peaceful feeling to the photograph. The overall composition focuses on showcasing the intricate details and natural beauty of the ladyâ€™s slipper orchid, making it the central subject of the image.","title":"Moccasin flower (fissipes acaulis), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["553369","554581","553365","554112","554586","553366","553588","554595","550462","555035","543597","554843","555034","554580","543200","553368"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","texture","weight","vein","elongate","curving","stem","accompany","manner"]}
