{"path":"549648.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features an urban street scene, likely taken during the mid-20th century. In the foreground, there is an entrance to an underground parking lot, labeled \"Garage Am Hof.\" A car, possibly from the 1970s, is depicted entering the garage. The car has a visible license plate reading \"N-19.911.\"\n\nDirectly above the garage, there is a large parking sign in a box frame, prominently displaying a white letter \"P\" and the words \"Garage Am Hof\" in a bold typeface. Below the main signage, additional information in smaller text appears to be specifying phone numbers and perhaps other relevant details for the garage.\n\nThe background shows the upper facades of European-style buildings with ornate, sculptural details and what appears to be a statue atop the nearest building, adding a classical architectural element to the scene. The sky is blue, suggesting it is a clear day.\n\nThe overall composition of the image with these elements conveys a typical city environment, juxtaposing everyday modern life with historical architectural elements.","title":"Vienna is building its parking lots underground in an attempt to relieve traffic congestion and preserve the charm of the city.
