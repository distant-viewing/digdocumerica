{"path":"552331.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene by a large body of water, possibly a lake or calm sea. It features two silhouetted figures standing on the rocks; the one on the left appears to be an adult, standing upright and facing forward, while the one on the right seems to be a child, with a slightly tilted posture suggesting movement or play. \n\nThe background is dominated by an undulating horizon of dark hills or mountains, softened by the haze of dusk. To the right, there is a distinct, large rock formation close to the water's edge, creating a striking silhouette against the dusky sky that is colored in gradients of purple and deep blue. The water surface is calm, reflecting some of the fading light and contributing to the tranquil atmosphere of the scene. The overall mood is peaceful and contemplative.","title":"Larrabee state park on puget sound at sunset, looking toward the San Juan islands","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["552226","550296","554759","553989","543140","550303","550288","554404","548222","543950","543143","552263","552225","547217","551280","543203"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["one","rock","soften","tilt","undulate","gradient","haze","right","sunset","dusk"]}
