{"path":"548127.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph features a waterfront scene with two prominent cargo ships docked at a quay. Both ships are large, and their hulls are mostly dark in color. The ship in the foreground has \"SEIHO MARU\" painted on its hull, indicating its name. It is equipped with several large cargo cranes, suggesting that it is a freight vessel designed for loading and unloading goods.\n\nThe background of the image shows a relatively calm body of water and a partly cloudy sky. The quay where the ships are docked appears to be reinforced with what looks like pilings or a type of breakwater made from large rocks along the water's edge. This assists in stabilizing the structure and preventing erosion. The scene is a typical industrial maritime environment, focusing mainly on the functionality of the space for maritime logistics and shipping activities.\n\nAside from the main subjects, there are no visible people or moving activity in the immediate vicinity, which gives the image a somewhat static and calm atmosphere. The lighting suggests that the photograph may have been taken during the daytime in partially sunny conditions. The overall tone and color palette consist of blues, grays, and earth tones that are typical for such industrial maritime settings.","title":"Logs will be taken aboard these ships at the mouth of the Columbia River for export to japan","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["546828","552244","546934","545845","548126","550910","547474","552216","551990","555260","551558","551577","552303","544657","552008","555270"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","maritime","hull","cargo","dock","breakwater","piling","prevent","stabilize","unload"]}
