{"path":"542657.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts two young people, a boy and a girl, engaged in an activity on a sandy beach. The girl, who has long blonde hair and wears a dark t-shirt paired with striped pants and grey boots, is kneeling. She appears focused on securing or opening a burlap sack laid on the ground, which contains various bits of debris or materials. Nearby, the boy, wearing a white long-sleeve shirt under a navy sweater and brown pants, is also kneeling. He is carefully reaching towards the sack, possibly picking smaller items from the sand or placing them inside the sack.\n\nThe environment around them appears somewhat desolate or undeveloped; the sand where they sit is littered with small debris. In the background, slightly out of focus, are utility poles stretching across the landscape, and a barely visible animal, possibly a dog, foraging or moving at a distance. The sky is overcast, casting a diffuse light over the scene which contributes to the gritty, somewhat stark atmosphere of the image. This setting suggests a remote or less-maintained coastal area, aligned with the activity of the children which may be related to cleaning up the beach or collecting objects from the shore.","title":"Eighth grade students from st.
