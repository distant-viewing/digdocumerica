{"path":"545565.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a rugged desert scene dominated by large red sandstone formations that form arches and hollows, creating a dramatic and natural backdrop. Under one of these arches, there is a small, ancient-looking stone structure, resembling a ruin with multiple levels of stone walls, which seems to be the focus of attention for the visitors.\n\nThere are four people in the image, likely tourists, exploring the area. To the far left, a person wearing a white hat and light-colored clothing stands facing towards the ruins, next to them is another individual in a red cap and blue jacket, positioned at a slightly higher elevation and looking towards the same direction. In the background, between the arches and stone structures, another visitor in lighter attire is partially visible. On the right side of the photograph, a man in a green jacket and dark-colored hat is walking away from the main scene, moving across the rocky terrain, which is scattered with stones and sparse vegetation.\n\nThe overall composition gives a strong sense of exploration and interest in ancient cultures or geologies, set in an impressive natural landscape that provides a sense of scale and the age of the surroundings. The lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, adding depth and enhancing the contours of the landscape.","title":"Tourists visit old Indian sites near Latrap Canyon","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545585","545581","545693","545702","545577","544903","545554","544951","545550","545567","545817","545700","545689","545782","545563","545305"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["arch","stone","ruin","visitor","geology","sandstone","jacket","hat","dark","explore"]}
