{"path":"548578.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a person, likely male, from a rear perspective as he bends over, possibly about to engage in a sporting activity or picking something up. His attire consists of a loose-fitting blue t-shirt and patterned shorts, which are plaid predominantly in shades of grey or blue. The person is also wearing dark socks pulled up near his knees and white athletic shoes, suggestive of an active, casual outdoor setting.\n\nThe subject is positioned on a grassy field, indicated by the green grass seen at the lower part of the image, and the focus on him creates a blurred background, obscuring clear details but hinting at a possibly park-like environment with trees.\n\nNotable is the lighting and coloring in the shot; it has a somewhat dark and moody tone, with shadows prominently visible on his shirt and the grass. The image almost seems underexposed, which pulls the focus tightly around the subject and his immediate surroundings, limiting the visibility of distant elements. The angle and composition focus on his upper legs and torso, emphasizing the act of bending over and the physicality of the moment.","title":"A sticky wicket on the croquet court.
