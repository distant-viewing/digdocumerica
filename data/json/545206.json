{"path":"545206.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a man involved in a fishing activity inside a tubular structure covered by a net. The man, appearing focused on his task, is dressed in a dark waterproof jacket, which is slightly glossy, indicating it might be wet.\n\nHe is handling what seems to be a large, slippery fish, possibly an eel or a similar aquatic creature, with both hands. This suggests he might be either sorting, examining, or preparing to relocate it. The action takes place inside a large, cylindrical tank, which is colored in rusty yellow and shows signs of wear and considerable use, evidenced by scratches and stains.\n\nIn the background, the net which envelops the scene suggests that this activity could be part of a controlled fishing environment, possibly a fish farm or a research facility intended to study or breed marine life. The net is taut and extends upwards, attached to a central pole that likely serves to hold the structure. This setup creates a partially shaded environment, which combined with the visible moisture on surfaces, suggests an outdoor setting.\n\nThe scene shown is illustrative of aquaculture or marine biology work, where humans directly interact with aquatic species, either for commercial, conservation, or research purposes.","title":"At the research station on pollution and supersaturation of the national environmental research center, a marine biologist examines chinook salmon for eggs and sperm","placename":"Corvallis (Or.)","location":"Corvallis, Oregon","nn1":["545211","545198","545202","545210","553095","550047","552273","545185","553332","549334","544961","552298","551412","546319","553650","544256"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["net","research","fish","fishing","biology","aquaculture","breed","scratch","envelop","creature"]}
