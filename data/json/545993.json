{"path":"545993.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat desolate industrial landscape that contrasts sharply with natural elements in the foreground. In the foreground, there's a lush, wild thicket of dense vegetation, featuring a variety of plants and tall grasses, giving off a sense of untamed wilderness. Among the flora, some plants have white blooms, adding small spots of brightness to the greenery.\n\nDominating the middle ground and extending to the background is a bleak industrial site. The area appears largely barren, with vast stretches of brown and muddy ground. There are large piles of industrial debris scattered throughout the site, which looks like it might be either a dumping ground or a construction site undergoing significant earth-moving activities. The ground is uneven and marked by patches of water, creating a mottled appearance.\n\nIn the far background, the skyline is lined with numerous industrial structures, possibly factories or processing plants. These facilities have multiple tall chimneys that are likely contributing to the industrial activity evident in the scene. The sky above the scene appears cloudy and overcast, casting a dull light over the landscape and reinforcing the grim industrial feel of the photograph.","title":"Exxon refinery in the distance behind a landfill dumping area","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["545989","546084","550343","555542","552154","546080","549965","545112","543813","546073","546974","551555","545053","547539","546978","546122"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["site","plant","mottled","ground","thicket","undergo","dumping","bloom","flora","brightness"]}
