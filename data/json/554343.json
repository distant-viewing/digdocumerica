{"path":"554343.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"In the photograph, a woman stands at a podium in a dark setting, delivering a speech. She is dressed in a bright red jacket and glasses, appearing to be actively speaking as suggested by her open mouth and animated facial expression. The podium in front of her has a microphone attached, and she holds a sheet of paper from which she seems to be reading. The background is mostly obscured by darkness, focusing all attention on her and the lectern. A subtle element of a logo or emblem appears to be visible on the podium, although it is mostly shrouded in shadow, adding a hint of the formal or institutional context of the event. The overall mood conveyed is one of seriousness and engagement in communication.","title":"Participant in a citizens' forum held in midtown Manhattan to discuss transportation problems and clean air strategies for New York city proposed by epa's regional office","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554337","554344","554342","554338","557703","554333","554345","543924","556253","543925","546550","556244","556451","549114","558293","544069"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["animate","speech","seriousness","deliver","microphone","emblem","sheet","communication","shroud","mouth"]}
