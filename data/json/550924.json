In the foreground, an older man is seen walking a white poodle on a leash. The man is dressed in a pastel yellow polo shirt and grey shorts, walking barefoot on the beach, suggesting a relaxed atmosphere. His posture is upright, and he is looking ahead as he walks.\n\nIn the midground, a couple walks towards the camera. The man is wearing patterned swim trunks and is balding, while the woman is in a black bikini and her hair styled in an afro. Both appear to be engaged in conversation, enjoying a leisurely walk on the sand.\n\nThe background shows a more crowded beach area, with several beach umbrellas and cabanas providing shade for beachgoers. People are scattered throughout, some sitting on chairs, others standing or walking, suggesting a typical busy day at the beach. The ocean is visible in the very background, calm and extending to the horizon under a clear blue sky.\n\nOverall, the setting is lively yet relaxed, indicative of a warm, sunny day at the beach where people have come to enjoy the sun, sand, and company.","title":"Stewart Beach, on the eastern end of Galveston Island, Galveston's 30 miles of ocean front makes it one of the most popular of Gulf Coast resorts.","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["548623","553951","548695","550929","550936","548541","547503","543474","543500","546794","547628","550932","550930","547482","553685","550239"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sand","leash","afro","beachgoer","polo","swim","bikini","walk","umbrella"]}
