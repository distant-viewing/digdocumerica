{"path":"554635.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque lakeside scene dominated by a lush, mountainous landscape in the background. The mountain, covered predominantly in dense trees that are beginning to show autumnal colors—warm oranges, reds, and golds blending with green—creates a vibrant and colorful backdrop. This scene is set under a clear, bright blue sky.\n\nIn the foreground, the lake itself occupies the central to lower part of the image, its cool, dark waters calmly reflecting some of the foliage and the sky. The lake's shore is gently landscaped with a neatly kept, vibrant green grassy area. Dotted around this grassy area, several dark green Adirondack chairs are either occupied or vacant, inviting quiet relaxation and enjoyment of the view.\n\nTo the left, the shoreline curves inward slightly, enhancing the sense of a private, secluded spot. Near the shore, there's a small, distinct red tree among the predominantly green and yellow foliage, adding a splash of vivid color that draws the eye.\n\nCloser to the water's edge, a few wooden docks extend into the lake, presumably for boating or swimming access. There are no visible boats, suggesting a moment of quiet or off-season timing. Some small, white buoys float on the water, possibly marking off swimming areas or paths for boats.\n\nOverall, the photograph epitomizes a peaceful, idyllic lakeside retreat, ideal for relaxation and nature appreciation, capturing the essence of a clear, bright autumn day.","title":"Blue Mountain and Blue Mountain Lake devoid of tourists who usually are gone by Labor Day.
