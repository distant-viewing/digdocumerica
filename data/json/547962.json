{"path":"547962.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a vintage fuel oil truck labeled \"Liberty Park Fuel Oil\" with servicing areas noted as Brooklyn, Queens, and Nassau. The truck is painted in a red color scheme with white text, and contact information \"326-3264\" is also visible on the side and rear of the truck. The phrase \"Liberty For Dependability\" is highlighted in white script along the upper side of the tank.\n\nThe truck's rear compartment door is open, revealing machine parts and equipment inside. There seems to be some sort of mechanism or engine components stored or being maintained within this back area.\n\nA man is standing on the back of the truck, leaning slightly towards the open compartment, possibly doing maintenance or checking equipment. He is dressed in dark work attire that includes a long coat.\n\nThe background shows a structure that possibly serves as a garage or shelter for vehicles, which includes a metal framework and roofing that partially covers the truck. The overall ambiance suggests a working environment typical of an industrial or service yard.\n\nThe image hints at a clear, bright day as indicated by the lighting and visible shadows on the truck and structures around.","title":"Oil truck at the John F.
