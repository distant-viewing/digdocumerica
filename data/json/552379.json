{"path":"552379.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a city street scene, apparently taken during daylight under hazy or smoggy conditions. The vantage point is from the side of the street, looking down a long avenue that extends towards a slightly obscured horizon due to the haze. The street is lined on both sides with tall palm trees and lamp posts regularly spaced along the sidewalk. \n\nIn the middle of the road, a yellow school bus travels away from the viewpoint, adding a bright pop of color against the more muted background colors. On the right-hand side of the image, parallel parked cars line the street, predominantly from what appears to be the 1970s era, given their styles and shapes. To the left, the roadside is partially obscured by another vehicle in the foreground, but a glimpse of it shows additional vehicles and possibly some small buildings or storefronts.\n\nThe general ambience suggests a typical busy urban environment, possibly in a Southern California city, indicated by the presence of palm trees and the style of architecture seen faintly in the distance. There are signs visible, but they are too blurry to read clearly, suggesting commercial activity. The overall muted and hazy color palette possibly evokes a hot and smoggy day in the city.","title":"Los angeles reactive pollutant program (larpp), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the coordinating research council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["544005","544013","553682","553688","555782","549886","549831","549856","556194","556709","547369","556791","556732","556729","545432","547651"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["palm","street","city","avenue","pop","storefront","school","ambience","obscure","roadside"]}
