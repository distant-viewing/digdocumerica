{"path":"556336.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts a group of miners gathered in what appears to be a lift or a confined underground setting, typical of a mining environment. There are eight men visible, and they all seem to be wearing work attire suitable for mining, including helmets equipped with lights. The miners vary in age and are attentively engaged in what looks like a critical moment, possibly related to their work duties or a briefing.\n\nThe central figure in the image is a man speaking into a portable radio or communication device, suggesting that he might be a supervisor or someone in a coordinating role. His expression is serious and focused, reinforcing the importance of the communication. The men surrounding him are equally attentive, looking either at the speaker or in the same direction, indicating shared concern or interest.\n\nThe immediate background includes two safety signs, one stating \"NO SMOKING CARRYING MATCHES\" and another emphasizing \"GOOD HOUSEKEEPING IS THE KEY TO SAFETY.\" These signs hint at the hazardous conditions typically present in such work environments and the precautions necessary to maintain safety standards.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of professional interaction among miners, characterized by a collective focus and the utilitarian surroundings of their workplace. The lighting is muted, and the attire and protective gear of the miners point to the practical and hazardous nature of their work.","title":"Shift of miners in the elevator which will take them down to work in the Virginia-Pocahontas Mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia.
