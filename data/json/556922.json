{"path":"556922.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph depicting a patchwork of activities within what appears to be a forested landscape. The majority of the frame is covered with dense, dark green coniferous trees suggesting a healthy, dense forest. In the midst of this natural expanse, there is a notable area of land-clearing or a logging site.\n\nThe cleared area cuts a swath through the forest, displayed in rectangular patches of light brown and beige soil exposed against the surrounding greenery. This suggests staged or phased logging, where certain parcels are cleared while others are left intact for regeneration or conservation purposes. A winding dirt road can be seen adjacent to these cleared patches, facilitating access to the area, likely used by logging vehicles or machinery.\n\nNo people or moving vehicles are visible in the photograph. The setting evokes a sense of solitude and focuses on the contrast between natural forest preservation and human land use. The image captures the impact of logging activities, emphasizing the interaction and tension between industrial development and environmental landscapes.","title":"Aerial view of typical re-growth Douglas fir land at the Bangor annex navy installation.
