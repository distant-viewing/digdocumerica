{"path":"557966.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features an old-fashioned steam locomotive pulling a passenger train along a curved track through a lush, green landscape. The locomotive is predominantly black, with white accents around the wheels and lettering that reads \"CUYAHOGA VALLEY LINE,\" suggesting it serves or is themed around the Cuyahoga Valley area. Dark smoke billows from its stack, suggesting the train is in operation.\n\nAttached to the locomotive is a passenger car painted black with windows along its length; the name \"CUYAHOGA VALLEY LINE\" is also visible on the side of this car. A few individuals can be seen through the windows of the passenger car, appearing as silhouettes due to the lighting conditions.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is verdant, characterized by dense trees in varying shades of green under a partly cloudy sky. The track on which the train runs appears to be well-maintained, with gravel bedding seen clearly beneath the track. Overall, the scene conveys a historical or nostalgic atmosphere, possibly representing a heritage railway line in operation for either tourist or educational purposes. The composition effectively captures the moving train rounding a bend, offering a dynamic sense of movement amid a serene natural setting.","title":"Cuyahoga Valley Line steam powered weekend excursion train passes through Boston Mills, Ohio, near Cleveland. It was once a busy community as it serviced commerce on the Ohio-Erie Canal. The train starts at the Cleveland Zoo Station and travels through part of the 30,000 acre Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area in a southerly direction to near Akron. The valley is the last major undeveloped land remaining between the two metropolitan areas.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557963","557967","557956","556106","556759","557960","557965","556104","556850","556120","556009","549131","556029","556857","556111","548536"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["locomotive","train","passenger","track","car","heritage","round","operation","tourist","accent"]}
