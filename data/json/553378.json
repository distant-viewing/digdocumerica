{"path":"553378.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph depicts an active construction site with heavy machinery and extensive earthmoving activities. In the foreground, a large area is covered in mud with visible tire tracks crisscrossing in various directions, indicating frequent movement of vehicles and equipment. A prominent yellow dump truck is centered in the image, equipped with large rugged tires and a loaded dump body filled with soil. Towards the left of the frame, another part of the site shows a few more construction vehicles, including a white pickup truck and heavy machinery, partially obscured by piles of dirt and excavation zones.\n\nThe middle ground of the image gives a broader view of the site, revealing scattered construction machinery, temporary structures, and unsettled earth, suggesting the scale and scope of the operation. There are piles of excavated soil and several deep trenches indicating ongoing groundwork for foundations or utilities.\n\nThe background features a dense treeline, delineating the boundaries of the construction area. Above the trees, the sky is clear and the environment appears to be in a rural or semi-rural setting based on the surrounding greenery and lack of urban structures. The overall scene is bustling with activity, typical of large-scale construction projects, focused on preparing the land for further development or specific construction purposes.","title":"Clearing the way for construction of a sewage treatment plant, an EPA assisted project","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["552814","544812","553383","553382","543105","557479","550274","556939","555608","543107","553391","545665","545652","553394","547243","549169"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["construction","dump","tire","machinery","site","pile","soil","truck","scope","trench"]}
