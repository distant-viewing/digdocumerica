{"path":"556615.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rural, somewhat deserted landscape, dominated by a dusty road stretching into the distance. In the foreground, several discarded beverage cans (specifically, \"Coors\" beer cans) are scattered prominently along the roadside, highlighting themes of littering or environmental neglect. The road itself is unpaved and appears desolate, edged by dry grass and shrubs, which suggests a dry or arid environment. Farther down the road, a white pickup truck is visible, raising clouds of dust as it travels, adding a sense of movement to the otherwise still scene.\n\nThe background features a range of low mountains and a clear, bright sky, contributing to a sense of openness and isolation. Sparse utility poles line the road, emphasizing the rural setting and perhaps the stretched connectivity in the area. The lighting indicates a sunny day, casting sharp shadows and enhancing the contrast of the natural and man-made elements in the scene.\n\nOverall, the image conveys themes of remoteness and abandonment, contrasted by the human impact on nature through the presence of litter.","title":"Empty steel beer and soft drink cans that litter the countryside could become a sight of the past if the experimental houses built from them near Taos, New Mexico, become popular.  Some 70,000 cans are needed to build one structure so the can manufacturing industry is watching with interest.
