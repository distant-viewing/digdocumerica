{"path":"552584.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a forested landscape, primarily filled with sparse vegetation and scattered trees. The terrain is rough and uneven, dominated by hills that roll softly into the distance. The topography is accentuated by deep shades of green and brown, typical of semi-arid forests or woodlands. In the foreground, a large area filled with felled trees and other debris creates a sense of recent logging or land clearing activity.\n\nAmidst the clearing, there's a noticeable human presence, where a white commercial truck is parked next to what appears to be a red storage tank or container. This suggests some form of industrial or construction operation is taking place. There are no visible people in the scene, which focuses more on the impact of human activity on the natural landscape. The background features gentle hills that stretch across the horizon under a clear sky, hinting at a vast and remote setting. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of solitude and the stark contrast between natural landscapes and human industrial endeavors.","title":"On oil shale lease site \"c-b\" a Denver company salvages wood from a bureau of land management (blm) chaining project.
