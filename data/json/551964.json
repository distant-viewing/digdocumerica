{"path":"551964.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene set along a desolate stretch of what appears to be an old, damaged road or riverbank. The main visual elements include:\n\n1. **Surface and Debris**: The ground is strewn with various types of debris, including small branches, rocks, and scattered trash. The surface appears muddy and wet, suggesting recent rain or proximity to a water body.\n\n2. **Person**: There is a lone individual standing near the center of the image, oriented away from the camera, seemingly looking down or engaged in observing the ground. The person is dressed in dark clothing, possibly wearing a jacket and pants, suitable for outdoor exploration or work.\n\n3. **Road or Pathway**: A damaged road or pathway stretches from the foreground into the distance along the photo’s right side. The path is cluttered with debris and puddles, and it appears neglected and in a state of disrepair.\n\n4. **Vegetation**: On the left side, there is dense underbrush or grass, and beyond it, a line of barren trees. This suggests a late autumn or winter setting, given the lack of foliage.\n\n5. **Utility Poles**: A row of utility poles follows the road/pathway, adding a sense of linear perspective leading the viewer’s eye through the scene. The poles are aged and weathered, contributing to the rundown feel of the location.\n\n6. **Red Barrel**: Noticeably, there is a red barrel positioned on the ground near the person. Its vivid color contrasts starkly with the otherwise muted tones of the scene.\n\n7. **Background Structures**: In the distance, along the road or pathway, there are some indistinct structures, possibly sheds or small buildings, which look dilapidated and abandoned.\n\n8. **Overall Mood and Lighting**: The lighting in the photo suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with a soft light that enhances the melancholic and abandoned atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe entire composition conveys a sense of loneliness and neglect, highlighting themes of abandonment and perhaps the passage of time, as nature slowly reclaims a once-used or inhabited space.","title":"Ranger from Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore surveys Beverly Shores road washed out by severe storm on Lake Michigan.","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547522","556313","544751","550253","550246","547039","547689","554565","556324","557345","547653","552102","553476","547622","551330","547771"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["pathway","road","underbrush","pole","puddle","debris","ground","barrel","stretch","person"]}
