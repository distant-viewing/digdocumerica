{"path":"551972.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image captures a sun-drenched beach scene featuring three women sitting on towels and engaging in casual conversation. The woman on the left is cross-legged and wears a red one-piece swimsuit, and has her dark hair tied up in a bun. The woman in the middle, partly obscured and facing left, is wrapped in a vibrant, patterned fabric, possibly a towel or a cover-up. The woman on the right is positioned with one leg extended and the other bent, wearing a white halter-neck bikini. She appears to be actively talking or laughing.\n\nThe ground surrounding them is sandy, suggesting a lakeside or seaside location, evidenced by the glimpse of tranquil blue water in the background. Among their belongings, several personal items such as a drink cup, sandals, and a bag are visible, scattered casually around them. The daytime setting under a clear sky and the relaxed, leisurely posture of the subjects convey a calm, summertime atmosphere.","title":"Enjoying the sunshine at Calumet Park Beach on Lake Michigan, in Chicago's South Side","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["546768","547507","543534","550920","551093","552952","548541","548699","547688","550936","550929","547935","548113","546794","551306","544206"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["towel","woman","halter","bun","summertime","sandal","seaside","belonging","bikini","swimsuit"]}
