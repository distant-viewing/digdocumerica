{"path":"554538.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a significant environmental issue, showing a large pile of assorted trash in a forest setting. The heap of garbage includes a variety of discarded items such as cans, bottles, plastic bags, and food wrappers, broadly representing consumer waste.\n\nIn the background, two young individuals appear, standing amidst the trees and observing the scene. One person wears a hat, a T-shirt emblazoned with the letters \"UR\", and jeans, and the other is also casually dressed. They seem disheartened or possibly concerned about the pollution, indicated by their gestures and somber expressions.\n\nThe dense forest around them features tall trees, ferns, and shrubs, typical of a woodland area. The contrast between the natural greenery and the colorful litter foregrounds the intrusion of human waste into a natural environment, underlining the pressing issue of environmental degradation. The image communicates a powerful message about pollution, the necessity for environmental consciousness, and the impact of human activities on natural habitats.","title":"Garbage pit near a state lean-to at Indian Falls on the trail to Mount Marcy, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551247","544298","550687","555228","544644","552100","543589","549957","543824","551440","550258","552098","547524","550352","544652","544648"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["issue","waste","pollution","consumer","intrusion","fern","forest","gesture","litter","heap"]}
