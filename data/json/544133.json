{"path":"544133.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a young boy at the beach, engaged in an intimate and playful moment with a large beach ball. The boy, who appears to be enjoying a sunny day, is shirtless and wearing bright red swim trunks adorned with a small, embroidered design near the hem on the left leg.\n\nThe boy is in a close-up encounter with the beach ball, which nearly engulfs his face as he seems to be either kissing or blowing the ball. The ball itself is colorful, featuring large panels of red, white, and blue. He holds the ball with both hands, gently pressing his lips against it. His eyes are closed, suggesting a moment of enthusiasm or affection towards the playful object.\n\nHis stance and the position of his arms show a gentle yet firm grip on the ball, implying a moment of playful interaction. The background is softly blurred, with hints of a sandy environment indicating a beach setting. It appears to be a bright, sunny day given the vivid colors and clear light cascading over the scene.\n\nThe photo captures the essence of childhood summer days: playful, carefree, and vividly colorful.","title":"At lake powell","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544413","551544","549105","550244","548805","550229","543688","547727","551548","543225","547867","550241","543459","552702","552942","545307"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["ball","beach","boy","encounter","press","affection","blow","enthusiasm","engulf","carefree"]}
