{"path":"544583.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene of destruction, possibly following a natural disaster. In the foreground, there is a curved pathway or border, made from concrete, that appears damaged and broken, with parts of it disjointed and raised from the ground. There are various debris and miscellaneous objects scattered throughout the scene including pieces of wood, fragments of concrete, and disheveled greenery.\n\nProminently, at the center of the pathway, stands a broken object resembling a street or parking lot light fixture, with its lamp and components tilted and hanging downward, indicative of forceful damage. A red object, possibly a plastic bucket, lies next to the broken concrete pieces.\n\nThe background presents a broader view of the devastation. There is a field with upturned soil, scattered debris, and a few vehicles in varied conditionsâ€”some appear intact while others are partially obscured by the debris or have damaged exteriors. The scene is set against a backdrop of trees and a blue sky, hinting that the photograph was taken on a clear day. There are no visible human figures in the image, suggesting the focus is on the impact and aftermath of the event that caused this damage. Further in the distance, additional structural damage can be inferred, though details are not distinct.","title":"River flood damage","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["557993","544468","544467","544466","544463","547888","547868","547130","544458","544454","544464","547527","548742","553863","544797","546120"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["damage","concrete","pathway","object","debris","piece","devastation","disaster","fragment","destruction"]}
