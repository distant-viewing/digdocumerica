{"path":"557018.jpg","date":"November 1974","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph shows a tranquil, forested scene captured in a temperate climate. A narrow, gravel pathway, sprinkled with fallen leaves, winds gently through the scene from the foreground to the middle distance. On the left side, a dense stand of dark coniferous trees creates a shadowy barrier, casting part of the path in shadows. To the right, the forest opens up slightly with mixed vegetation, including some young coniferous trees and deciduous trees showcasing some autumnal color change in their thinning foliage.\n\nThe background is obscured by a thick mist or fog that sets in among the trees, giving the entire landscape a mysterious and somewhat ethereal quality. The lighting is subdued, perhaps indicative of an overcast day, which enhances the muted colors of the greens, browns, and faint yellows of the scene. The composition evokes a sense of solitude and calmness, typical of a quiet woodland area, with the path inviting the viewer to imagine walking into the fog-shrouded forest.","title":"Christmas tree farm along Holly Highway at Wildcat Lake Road. This acreage and others like it are expected to come under increased land use pressure when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby. A \"new city\" is proposed to house a substantial portion of the projected 27,000 people who will move into the area when the naval installation is completed.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["557822","554720","555215","554664","544860","557940","554718","555127","553464","558082","557601","554394","542849","553373","554728","554965"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["path","forest","woodland","stand","calmness","tree","fog","gravel","yellow","change"]}
