{"path":"555554.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph shows a group of four pelicans in flight, captured against a clear sky background. The birds are aligned horizontally across the frame, adding a sense of movement and direction. They are positioned at different heights, giving the image a staggered, dynamic appearance. Each pelican is captured with its wings in various positions of the flapping cycle, suggesting a frozen moment during their flight.\n\nThe pelicans have large, heavy bodies with broad wings, characteristics that are typical for this type of bird. The color of their plumage appears to be a blend of white and grayish tones, though the exact colors are muted in the photoâ€™s exposure. Splashes of black can be observed on the tips of their wings.\n\nThe background is a uniform blue, which suggests that it is either a clear sky or a calm body of water reflected in bright daylight. Some small, blurry spots can be observed in the sky, possibly indicating distant birds or dirt on the camera lens.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on capturing the graceful, coordinated motion of pelicans in flight, emphasizing their natural habitat and behaviors in the wild.","title":"Dead fish resulted in a four-mile stretch of the Olentangy River on June 20, 1974, when chemicals spilled into the river. The pollution was caused when a Pennwalt Corporation chemical storage building was desTroyed by fire and explosions. Authorities believe lightning caused the fire. EPA authorities supervised the cleanup.","placename":"Delaware (Ohio)","location":"Delaware, Ohio","nn1":["550903","552911","544500","550889","552909","545302","552912","544559","548728","545187","552238","557125","550382","544605","544609","554646"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["pelican","wing","flight","bird","behavior","plumage","cycle","tip","lens","black"]}
