{"path":"550229.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures two children engaged in play at the beach. The setting is near the water's edge where the beach sand meets the sea. A gentle wave can be seen approaching and partially wrapping around the area where the children are playing.\n\nOn the left, there is a young boy with blonde hair who is shirtless, kneeling on the sand. He is intensely focused on building or shaping something out of wet sand with his hands. On the right, another child with dark hair, also shirtless and wearing colorful swim trunks, is sitting close to the water. This child is leaning forward and similarly engaged in manipulating the sand, possibly helping the other child or creating his own structure.\n\nThe beach sand is dark and moist, indicative of recent or ongoing contact with the sea water, making it suitable for sand-play. The overall atmosphere of the scene is peaceful and absorbed, with the children's attention fully devoted to their sandy constructions. The natural daylight suggests it could be either late morning or early afternoon. This snapshot of childhood play presents a serene and timeless beachside activity.","title":"Huntington Beach on Lake Erie.
