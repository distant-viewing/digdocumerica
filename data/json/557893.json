{"path":"557893.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a bustling car service station, likely dated back to the mid-20th century based on the style of the vehicles and men's attire. The setting is an open, roofed structure, possibly a garage or a gas station, with a steel roof supported by pillars.\n\nIn the foreground, a man wearing a white shirt and dark trousers is actively engaged in refueling a vehicle using a hose from a fuel pump. The car appears to be a classic model from the 1960s with distinctive tailfins, likely an American make. This man is placed to the left of the frame, highlighting his action as central to the scene.\n\nIn the mid-ground, several other individuals, all also dressed in white shirts and dark pants that suggest a uniform, are attending to another vintage car. This second car is also reminiscent of 1960s American automotive design, featuring sleek, elongated lines. These men seem to be conversing or possibly coordinating tasks related to the car's maintenance or service.\n\nThe background reveals the interior of the station with multiple service bays open. The structure is spacious and functional, with other cars and maybe additional people partially visible. Natural light streams in from the sides and back, casting shadows and creating a vivid contrast of light and dark across the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of everyday work life in a mid-20th century American car service station, reflecting both the era's automotive design and the style of work environments of the time. The image evokes a sense of industriousness and the American car culture during a peak era of automotive prominence.","title":"City employee of an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, holds a probe attached to the tailpipe of a car being tested.
