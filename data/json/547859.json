{"path":"547859.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a suburban street scene, likely from the 1970s or 1980s, judging by the styles of the cars and architecture. The image features a row of two-story townhouses along a curved road. Each townhouse is identically designed with a mix of siding materials, including wood, stone, and shingle accents. The structures have prominent gabled roofs with white trim, rectangular and circular windows, and each home appears to have a small balcony on the upper level.\n\nParked along the curb are three cars demonstrating the automotive design of the era: in the foreground, a large red and white station wagon, closely followed by a dark sedan, and another dark vehicle partially visible behind. \n\nThe front yards of the townhouses are neatly manicured with sparse grass lawns, young trees, and simple landscaping. A white, wooden fence is seen enclosing one of the driveways. The road appears smooth and clean, suggesting a well-maintained urban environment.\n\nIn the background, beyond the houses, there's a hint of more residential structures, possibly indicating that this area is part of a larger suburban development. The sky is overcast, lending a soft, diffuse light to the scene, which emphasizes the tranquility and orderliness of this suburban setting.","title":"New housing at Grant City, Staten Island - a result of the building boom following completion of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547945","544452","557840","547433","556601","551102","557428","553705","545419","558157","558039","557365","557288","556950","550994","556435"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["townhouse","driveway","shingle","landscaping","curb","accent","wagon","balcony","sedan","road"]}
