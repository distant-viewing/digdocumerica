{"path":"554280.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph depicts two individuals engaged in conversation on an outdoor patio of a café or similar establishment. The weather appears to be cool, as suggested by their clothing.\n\nOn the left, there is a person wearing a yellow jacket and patterned pants, using crutches. This individual appears engaged and might be listening or speaking to the person on the right. The fashion suggests a retro style, possibly from the 1970s based on the flared pants and style of the jacket.\n\nOn the right stands another individual wearing a bright red jacket over a white turtleneck, holding a carton drink and a long French-style baguette wrapped in paper. He seems to be conversing actively, holding eye contact with the person on crutches.\n\nThe surroundings feature a black patio table with a dirty glass top and metal chairs around it. There's a scattered presence of smaller objects on the table, visible but indistinct. A chain-link fence partially encircles the patio, indicating a semi-private space. There seems to be a building or structure in the background, suggested by the presence of large window panes and what appears to be a wall.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a candid and possibly intimate moment of everyday social interaction in a casual, outdoor setting, with a distinct touch of vintage fashion.","title":"Skiing part of the trip is over for one young woman","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["557143","551462","554268","548482","551834","549292","551460","549291","551818","553167","554222","551433","550082","551469","549293","553244"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["patio","jacket","fashion","table","person","turtleneck","café","style","encircle","contact"]}
