{"path":"546545.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, suburban scene, likely on a sunny day given the brightness and shadows visible. In the foreground, a grassy area is crossed by a winding concrete pathway, which guides the composition of the photograph.\n\nTwo individuals are seen on this pathway. On the left, a woman in colorful clothing, possibly red and pink, walks leisurely. On the right, a person rides a bicycle and appears to be carrying a load on their back, perhaps secured by a backpack.\n\nThe background features modern residential architecture: two houses with dark brick facades and sharp, pitched roofs. Large windows are evident on the visible sides of these houses, suggesting an open, airy interior. The houses are surrounded by lush greenery, including tall trees and well-maintained shrubbery, which creates a feeling of privacy and a buffer from the surrounding area.\n\nThe overall atmosphere appears peaceful and quiet, suggesting a moment of daily life in a well-kept residential neighborhood. The setting hints at a well-planned area with attention to landscape and architectural design.","title":"W.  D.
