{"path":"554773.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a large strip mining operation. In the foreground, there is a massive mining machine characterized by a vibrant red color with white and black accents. The mining machine is equipped with an extensive conveyor system that includes a towering and intricate framework supporting a belt that likely transports excavated material.\n\nThe machinery is stationed atop a vast pile of rubble or mined material, consisting of varied sizes and shades of grey rock fragments. The landscape behind the machine slopes upward and is similarly covered with rough, rocky terrain, suggesting an extensive mining site.\n\nThe mining environment is sparse, with no vegetation visible, indicating the harshness and industrial nature of the setting. The sky above is clear, hinting at favorable weather conditions for mining operations. The scene is devoid of human activity in the visible areas, focusing entirely on the machinery and operation at hand. The atmosphere is utilitarian, emphasizing the scale and intensity of the mining operation.","title":"A relatively \"small\" shovel digs into a coal seam off Route 9.
