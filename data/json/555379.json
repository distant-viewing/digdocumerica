{"path":"555379.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up shot of a wristwatch prominently displayed in the foreground. The watch has a detailed, classic design featuring a dark face with gold markings and hands, along with multiple smaller dials within its main face suggesting additional functionalities like a chronograph. The watch's body and band are also finished in gold tones, enhancing its elegant appearance.\n\nThe background of the image is out of focus, creating a bokeh effect with various colored lights. These blurred lights vary in size and intensity, showing a palette of white, yellow, red, and green, hinting at a nighttime setting possibly in an urban environment with streetlights or illuminated signs in the distance. The use of shallow depth of field places all the emphasis on the watch, suggesting a moment captured, possibly signifying the importance of time in that instance. There's a subtle reflection on the glass of the watch, adding to the overall moody and atmospheric quality of the image.","title":"This night scene was taken at 7:45 p.m. after all commercial and neon lights were turned off September 29, 1973, by executive order from Governor Tom McCall to ease the energy shortage in the state.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["542794","551447","552637","551360","553883","546490","556128","557277","546557","548397","555441","547671","547763","549585","557610","556703"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["watch","instance","streetlight","wristwatch","face","nighttime","dial","importance","band","marking"]}
