{"path":"554690.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a group of riders on horseback traveling along a dirt road enveloped by a forest. The setting appears to be in a rural or wilderness area during the daytime. The road is fairly wide, slightly curved, and surrounded by dense trees that suggest the season might be either late summer or early autumn due to the greenery still visible on the trees.\n\nThe group of riders includes approximately eight people, spread out across the frame. They are casually dressed, potentially in outdoor or riding gear, and each rider is on a horse that appears to be walking calmly. The riders seem relaxed, engaged in their ride and possibly in conversation with one another.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is lush, with tall trees predominantly pine and deciduous types, lining both sides of the road. The light filtering through the canopy suggests it might be either morning or late afternoon. The area to the left of the road is sloping, and the right side of the road has a gentle incline leading up to more trees. Shadows cast across the road hint at a sun that is not directly overhead.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of peaceful coexistence with nature and a leisurely-paced activity that contrasts with more urban or hectic environments. The colors are natural and earthy, enhancing the serene and rustic feel of the scene.","title":"Riders on a fall trail ride.
