{"path":"554123.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph displays a real estate advertisement in a rural or undeveloped area. In the foreground, there is a large white sign that reads \"Puna Beach Palisades Fee Simple Estate Lots\" with additional contact information and a plot map showing the numbers of the lots, some of which are marked as \"SOLD.\" Below this main sign, there is a smaller red and white sign that says \"For Sale Aina Hale Realtors, Ltd\" with a phone number.\n\nThe landscape around the signs is open and largely undeveloped. It features patches of grass and weeds, and the soil looks volcanic, possibly indicating the geographic setting typical of some Hawaiian landscapes. There's no pavement visible, suggesting that the area is still very much in a natural state.\n\nIn the background, the expansive sky is partly cloudy, giving a sense of openness and vastness typical of rural settings. Likely, the area is either on the cusp of development or being advertised for future development. This setting suggests a focus on land and property sales in a region with potential for growth or increased domestic settlement. The presence of vegetation like low shrubs and small plants add color and a touch of wilderness to the scene.","title":"Developers sign, evidence of land speculation in Puna area near Kalapana. Volcanic soil and arid conditions inhibit agriculture, making land speculation popular in this area.
