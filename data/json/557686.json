{"path":"557686.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor setting that appears to be a small shop, likely from the 1970s or 1980s based on the clothing style and objects present. The scene captures a day-to-day transaction between the shopkeeper and two customers.\n\nThe shopkeeper, a middle-aged woman, is positioned to the right side of the frame. She wears a white sleeveless top with a floral pattern and is interacting with the customers or handling merchandise on the counter. Her attention seems to be focused on the items on the counter or perhaps giving change or a receipt.\n\nThe two customers, both young men, are partially visible. The man on the left wears a white T-shirt with colorful print on it and his face is turned away, facing the other man, suggesting a conversation or an interaction between them. The second man is only partially visible with his back to the camera, wearing a patterned blue shirt.\n\nThe counter is cluttered with a variety of items including a stack of newspapers, a promotional mug, and possibly other small goods. Behind the shopkeeper is a background filled with numerous boxes and packs of cigarettes from an array of brands. We can see prominent cigarette brands displayed, including More, Marlboro, and Kool, indicating the shop likely caters to tobacco products among other things.\n\nThe overall ambiance is casual, capturing a typical moment of purchase in a neighborhood store, reflective of everyday life and retail practices of the time. The image is rich in details that tell a story about the era, consumer habits, and small-scale retail environments.","title":"Mrs.  Warren brown (behind counter) operates the grocery inside the service station she and her husband have owned for 20 years in helen, Georgia, near robertstown.
