{"path":"556869.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image captures workers engaged in railway track maintenance or construction. The scene takes place on a cluster of railway tracks that extend into the distance, framed by natural greenery and partly cloudy skies. The photograph is shot from an elevated perspective, looking down the length of the railway.\n\nThe photograph features at least five workers. In the foreground, one worker in a blue outfit and hat is seen shaping the gravel base of the tracks using a long tool, possibly a rake or spade. Another, in a lighter shirt and dark pants, walks along a track carrying something on his shoulder. Further along the line, workers are spread out; one is walking towards the upper part of the image carrying a tool, another inspects or works on the tracks, and a fifth individual, partially visible, interacts with track components.\n\nThe tracks themselves are laden with wooden sleepers, some piled on one side, indicating ongoing construction or repair. Metallic elements of the track, possibly rails or rail fasteners, show signs of exposure to the elements, appearing worn and rusty.\n\nOn either side of the tracks, there's scattered greenery, and further to the right, a paved road runs parallel to the railway, bordered by what appears to be a guardrail. The autumnal hue of the vegetation suggests the season may be fall.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, combined with the gear and tasks being performed, reflects a typical railway maintenance scene, likely from the mid to late 20th century, focusing on the essential labor that keeps railway infrastructure in operational condition.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew, takes up old track after replacing it with quarter mile sections of new rails. On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded tracks per day. In 1974 Southern had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of track.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556859","556862","556883","556897","556881","556895","556871","556860","556886","556877","556889","556874","556899","556894","556884","556872"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["track","railway","worker","rail","tool","rake","maintenance","carry","guardrail","construction"]}
