{"path":"554884.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside what appears to be a rural shed or barn with open sides and a metal roof. The primary activity in this image is the shearing of sheep.\n\nThree individuals (all men) are visible in the image. Two men are actively engaged in shearing sheep. They are bending over the sheep, each holding shearing tools. One of these men is wearing jeans and a white t-shirt, while the other merely sports a pair of blue jeans and has removed his shirt, likely due to the physical nature of the work. Both are focusing intently on their tasks.\n\nThe third man, standing and observing the shearing, appears to be older and wears a grey button-up shirt paired with slacks and a hat, suggesting a supervisory or observational role. He stands with his hands on his hips, watching the ongoing work.\n\nIn the background, other sheep can be seen, some standing and others possibly waiting to be sheared. The floor of the shed is littered with clumps of wool, indicating that shearing has been taking place for some time.\n\nThe environment suggests a rustic and practical setup typical of agricultural or farm settings, with the focus purely on the task of shearing sheep, an essential activity for wool production. The photograph captures a moment of rural working life, highlighting the physical labor and expertise involved in this traditional practice.","title":"Sheep being sheared on a ranch in the Leakey, Texas, area near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["554892","554893","554894","554881","552568","544391","554883","554882","554886","554880","547396","552573","551657","554950","548952","552569"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["sheep","shed","pair","wool","jeans","expertise","work","clumps","hip","slack"]}
