{"path":"549061.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This close-up photograph shows a pair of hands performing a scientific procedure with a clear flask and pipette. The hands are holding the flask, which is partially filled with a liquid, and using the pipette to either add to or extract liquid from the flask. The hands are focused on this task, and they appear work-worn, suggesting practical experience, perhaps in a field environment.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, there is a young person observing the procedure. This individual has short blonde hair and a serious expression, indicating interest or concentration on the activity being performed. The background is a bright, clear blue sky, suggesting the setting is outdoors during a sunny day.\n\nThe overall composition centers on the scientific task, with the observer positioned such that the focus is shared between the activity and the learning or monitoring aspect depicted by the presence of the young observer. The framing and focus draw attention to the hands and the procedure, emphasizing the scientific or experimental nature of the scene.","title":"California Fish and Game biologist checks sample taken from Colorado River for oxygen content.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["542737","549605","549604","546296","546283","546327","546277","543801","549608","546275","549342","546323","549611","546284","546328","542666"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["flask","procedure","observer","liquid","hand","perform","task","extract","learning","monitoring"]}
