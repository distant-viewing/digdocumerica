{"path":"545788.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a rugged, expansive desert landscape typical of a canyon environment, viewed through a fisheye lens which creates a distinctive spherical distortion. The foreground features jagged, rocky terrain with patches of sparse vegetation, including shrubs and small trees. The rocky surface varies in color from light beige to deeper shades of brown and red, typical of sedimentary rock formations often found in canyon areas.\n\nIn the center of the image, a mountain bike rider is descending a narrow, rocky path. Due to the wide-angle effect of the lens, the biker appears small and is positioned in a crouched posture, navigating the rough trail. The background stretches into a wide horizon, showcasing a panoramic view of the canyon with layered rock formations that fade into the distance under a vast sky. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting variable weather conditions. The overall scene is desolate yet striking, emphasizing the challenging and adventurous nature of mountain biking in such a rugged terrain.","title":"Water Canyon, near the Maze, a very remote and rugged region near the center of the Canyonlands. Water Canyon gets its name from a spring within the canyon, which furnishes a good supply of pure water, a rarity in the region.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545764","545690","545760","545800","544950","545697","544917","545762","552892","545802","545799","545696","545749","544016","544899","545575"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","lens","formation","bike","rider","beige","mountain","rock","descend","trail"]}
