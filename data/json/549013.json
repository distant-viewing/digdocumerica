{"path":"549013.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a long, straight road extending from the foreground into the distant center, creating a deep perspective. A vehicle, which appears to be a white pickup truck, is traveling towards the viewer on the road. The road is flanked by sparsely vegetated desert terrain, characterized by small bushes and a rugged landscape. The land gradually rises to mountainous terrain in the background under a vast, hazy sky, which adds a sense of depth and isolation to the scene. The light conditions indicate a bright but slightly overcast day, contributing to the muted tones of the distant mountains and the overall serene atmosphere of the scene. The image captures a moment of travel in a remote, arid environment, emphasizing solitude and the vastness of the landscape.","title":"EPA laboratory monitor, Frank Reed, driving agency truck makes daily collections of water and air samples from atomic test site area.","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["544043","557468","545886","544178","548897","554154","554127","545575","545367","554130","553662","554155","556615","549002","554832","545336"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","pickup","travel","terrain","desert","vastness","bush","solitude","truck","isolation"]}
