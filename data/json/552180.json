{"path":"552180.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a sharp juxtaposition between industrial activity and leisure relaxation. In the foreground, two men are seated on a wooden platform by the water. The man on the left is dressed in a tank top and shorts, while the one on the right is shirtless, wearing just shorts. Both are facing away from the camera and appear to be engaged in a conversation, while looking out over the water.\n\nThe background is dominated by a large industrial complex. This complex features multiple tall structures, including silos, chimneys, and several buildings with visible staircases and piping. Smoke and steam can be seen billowing from multiple stacks, spreading into the sky, which hints at heavy industrial activity. The facility seems to be a processing plant or a factory of some sort, located on the edge of a body of water.\n\nThe water in the foreground shimmers slightly, reflecting a bit of the harsh, industrial setting opposite the natural calmness by which the two men are surrounded. The contrast in the photograph is striking, with the serene, calm demeanor of the men in sharp contrast to the busy, polluting nature of the industrial background. This composition highlights themes of human relaxation amidst the backdrop of environmental impact and industrialization.","title":"St. Regis Kraft pulp mill on Commencement Bay","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551959","550937","544328","550902","552139","550968","545996","546219","549220","552194","552210","550694","550995","550899","546145","552051"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["relaxation","short","man","industrialization","piping","staircase","calmness","sort","silo","water"]}
