{"path":"557757.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a young girl tending a small roadside stand showing an entrepreneurial spirit. She's focused on either preparing or packing items and stands behind a red table covered with a striped, colorful tablecloth. The table displays various produce items for sale including squash, cucumbers, and what appears to be bags of popcorn. A handwritten sign on the table details the prices of the items: \"Squash 3 for 25¢, Cucumbers 5 for 25¢, Lemonade 10¢ per cup.\"\n\nThe girl is wearing a yellow t-shirt with a slogan printed on it, “TELL IT LIKE IT IS,” and her hairstyle is indicative of the styles common in what seems to be the 1970s based on the image quality and fashion. \n\nIn the background, a wooden sign next to the stand lists other items possibly for sale or services offered like “WOOD,” “PLANTS,” “RABBITS,” and “CHICKENS.” The stand is likely positioned in front of a residential building; a glimpse of the white structure and a window can be seen, as well as a well-kept lawn with a variety of plants.\n\nThis scene likely depicts a warm, sunny day, ideal for outdoor sales, evidenced by the bright and clear lighting. The atmosphere looks peaceful and quaint, suggesting a suburban or rural setting. The mixture of the practical, homemade sign and the solitary focus of the girl provides a snapshot of small-scale domestic commerce.","title":"Youngster mans a roadside stand selling squash, cucumbers and lemonade on sims road and Georgia highway 356 at robertstown a mile northeast of helen.
