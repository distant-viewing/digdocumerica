{"path":"549397.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling scene aboard a large sailing yacht, named \"Moonbeam IV,\" as indicated by the text visible on the stern of the vessel. The yacht is equipped with various sails that appear to be in full use, adding a dynamic and active feel to the scene.\n\nOn deck, there is a group of approximately nine people, who are engaged in various activities related to sailing the vessel. The individuals display a casual, leisurely posture, suggesting a relaxed sailing atmosphere rather than a competitive event. The clothing styles are casual and suitable for a day at sea, with shorts, T-shirts, and sunglasses being the common attire among the group.\n\nThe photograph's background is hazy and mainly consists of the open sea, blending into a light grey sky, which suggests an overcast weather condition or possibly the start of a mild fog. This creates a soft background that contrasts with the clear and focused activities on the yacht.\n\nOverall, the photograph encapsulates a snapshot of maritime leisure activity, focusing on the crew's interaction with the boat and the sea, highlighted by a relaxed yet attentive ambiance among the passengers and crew. The setting and the vessel evoke a sense of adventure and the enjoyment of sailing.","title":"Contender in the Annapolis-Newport race on Chesapeake Bay in the early hours of the race.
