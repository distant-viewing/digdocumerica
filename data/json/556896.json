{"path":"556896.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a railway track featuring a solitary worker involved in manual labor. The man, wearing a dark jacket and jeans, is actively engaged in using a long metal tool, likely a lever or pry bar, to work on the railway. He is bent over in exertion, his focus directed towards the task at hand. The photo has a strong presence due to the contrast of the worker's attire against the silvery metal of the rail and the muted colors of the gravel and wooden ties that make up the track.\n\nThe setting appears to be outdoors during daylight, with sunlight illuminating the scene and casting a crisp shadow of the man on the gravel. The background and peripheral regions of the image primarily consist of more railway tracks and wooden ties, suggesting a rather industrial or utilitarian location, dedicated to rail transport. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of hard, physical work typically associated with rail track maintenance and the gritty environment of such industrial settings.","title":"Southern railway right-of-way worker jacks up a rail so ties can be replaced.  In 1974 southern spent 18.6 percent of its revenue on track maintenance.  That year the company laid 91,808 tons of rails and placed 2,278,318 railroad ties.  The maximum safe speed for the system's 10,531 miles of track usually is 60 miles per hour.  That contrasts with another company which had some track with a safe maximum speed of eight miles per hour","placename":"Alexandria (Va.)","location":"Alexandria, Virginia","nn1":["556883","556884","555561","556869","556870","556871","556898","556862","556881","556899","556890","556012","556860","556859","556861","556901"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["track","rail","railway","gravel","tie","worker","exertion","lever","silvery","bar"]}
