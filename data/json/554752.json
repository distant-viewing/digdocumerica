{"path":"554752.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, early morning or dusk scene centered around a tranquil lake. The foreground features several tall conifer trees that are silhouetted against the lighter sky, adding depth and frame to the image. Beyond the trees, the calm surface of the lake stretches horizontally across the image, reflecting the subtle hues of the sky.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows the lake continuing towards a wooded shoreline, which is filled with more dark silhouettes of trees that create a natural boundary along the water. Beyond the shoreline, the background presents a range of softly outlined mountains or hills that fade into the mist. The sky itself is a gentle gradient, transitioning from a mild purple to soft peach tones near the horizon, suggesting the presence of either a rising or setting sun.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is peaceful and contemplative, induced by the gentle colors and the stillness of the scene. This photographic composition beautifully captures a quiet moment in a natural landscape, emphasizing the tranquility of a lakeside environment at a quiet time of day.","title":"Early fall morning with mist below colvin mountain at little moose lake, near indian lake and cedar river flow","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["543590","550746","552319","557570","543577","557021","552336","550735","557493","554760","554405","554397","543604","557561","551207","557000"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["lake","shoreline","silhouette","continue","purple","stillness","gradient","boundary","mist","outline"]}
