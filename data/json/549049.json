{"path":"549049.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph appears to be taken in a wide, flat, and barren landscape. In the foreground, there's a prominent wooden sign, painted in a rustic manner with the words \"FREE ONIONS\" in bold, red, uneven letters. The sign is slightly tilted and held by a support, likely also made of wood.\n\nIn the middle ground of the image, several individuals can be seen in a scattered formation, actively engaged in some kind of activity on a field littered with what could be strands and bulbs of onions. Their actions suggest they might be harvesting or collecting the onions from the ground.\n\nSeveral vehicles, including cars and a truck, are parked nearby, suggesting that this might be a temporarily halted activity where people can stop by to collect onions freely. The presence of these vehicles and the nature of the signage suggest a rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nThe background features a stark, desert-like terrain with some sparse vegetation and distant hills or rock formations. The sky is clear and the setting appears to be sunny, casting shadows that help define the midday time.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of agricultural generosity, possibly aimed at community sharing or preventing food waste, set against a rustic and arid backdrop typical of farming communities in certain regions.","title":"Processing plant offers its discarded onions to all comers","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549044","544010","558089","549050","554936","542589","547782","553698","543845","555874","549079","554922","555369","553662","554015","546964"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["collect","formation","strand","bulb","prevent","harvest","midday","community","tilt","casting"]}
