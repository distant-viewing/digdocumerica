{"path":"549186.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural, natural landscape under a blue sky with scattered clouds. The foreground is lush with greenery, featuring an assortment of grasses and wildflowers, peaking in hues of yellow and dull reds. The middle ground shows a green cluster of low scrub and bushes, transitioning into an open space with sparse vegetation. The background consists of a large, softly rolling hill that dominates the scene, barren of trees and mostly covered in reddish-brown earth with some greenery. The overall scene gives an impression of a quiet, serene, and possibly windy environment typical of a high plain or steppe region. The lack of any human presence or man-made structures emphasizes the untouched, natural aspect of the landscape.","title":"Untouched prairie grasses in foreground provide sharp contrast to the land behind, which has been \"reclaimed\" following strip-mining operations.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["552903","549227","549238","549157","549236","549142","549155","555616","557189","552914","549229","557087","549156","550440","545040","557191"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["scrub","assortment","wildflower","greenery","lack","peak","aspect","red","bush","impression"]}
