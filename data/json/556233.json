{"path":"556233.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a tender moment likely captured during a church service or a similar religious event. The focus is on a baby, dressed in a white outfit, cradled securely in the arms of a woman who is mostly out of frame on the right side. The woman holding the baby is possibly her mother or a close relative, evident from her caring posture and the gentle way she supports the baby.\n\nIn the foreground to the left, there's a partial view of another woman who is looking down at a book sheâ€™s holding, which might be a hymnal or a Bible, indicating the setting could be a religious service.\n\nBehind them, there are a few more individuals, with at least two men and one woman visible. These individuals are dressed formally; the men are wearing suits, and the woman has a decorative necklace, suggesting a special occasion. Everyone seems to be focused on something out of view, possibly a speaker or an ongoing ceremony.\n\nThe image is warmly lit, with subdued and soft lighting that contributes to the serene and solemn atmosphere of the scene. The expressions, particularly of the baby and the woman holding the book, add a personal and intimate touch to the photograph, enhancing the sense of a community gathered for an important occasion.","title":"Photograph of an African-American family at Chicago's Church of the Messiah","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["558405","558409","557368","553496","558172","556145","556294","557369","553533","556144","556235","556299","550090","558171","551473","543863"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["baby","woman","occasion","book","service","ceremony","mother","speaker","necklace","church"]}
