{"path":"543289.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid and picturesque coastal scene. The foreground features a body of dark blue water, shimmering under the sunlight with scattered wave patterns. Jutting out from these waters are several rugged rock formations covered in various marine growths, suggesting they are frequently submerged under a higher tide. The rocks appear in different sizes and are strategically placed in the left-middle portion of the image, contributing to the visual depth of the scene.\n\nBeyond the immediate aquatic landscape, a sandy cove is visible, hugged by more rocky formations where the water meets the land. This adds a serene contrast to the dynamic water and harsher rock textures in the foreground. \n\nThe background features rolling coastal hills, which slope sharply into the cove area. These hills are covered with a mixture of greenery and dry, brownish vegetation, typical of a coastal ecosystem which balances between marine moisture and exposure to sun. The skyline is clear and sunny, suggesting a fair weather day which illuminates everything brightly and enhances the natural colors of the landscape.\n\nThis scene likely captures the essence of a rugged coastline, where water and earth meet dynamically, inspiring a sense of natural beauty and tranquility. The photograph as a whole offers a well-composed snapshot of coastal geomorphology and ecology, ideal for appreciating or studying natural coastal environments.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543297","543309","543250","545122","543299","545173","543291","553805","547486","542917","545230","543337","543300","553775","543068","543328"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cove","meet","rock","formation","hug","inspire","water","appreciate","tide","jut"]}
