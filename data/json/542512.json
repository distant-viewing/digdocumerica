{"path":"542512.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking outdoor scene featuring a series of shadows cast by people standing atop an expansive barren earth surface. The elongated shadows stretch across the cracked, dry, reddish-brown terrain displaying a kind of gritty texture. The shadows are sharply defined and appear darker against the lighter, uneven ground, suggesting the sunlight is strong and possibly low in the horizon, like during the morning or late afternoon.\n\nAt the left side of the frame, the shadows lead to the actual figures, which are not visible due to the camera angle aiming more towards the ground. The number of shadows suggest a group of people, each standing apart from one another, which creates an artistic, elongated pattern across the surface.\n\nIn the background, the landscape rolls gently into hills, devoid of any visible vegetation, under a wide, clear blue sky that makes up the top quarter of the photograph. The overall scenery is stark yet dramatic, primarily characterized by the vast, unbroken vista and the interplay of light and shadow. The composition of the photograph, with its focus on the shadows instead of the people casting them, adds a sense of mystery and abstraction to the scene.","title":"Oil waste on Barren hillside","placename":"Coalinga (Calif.)","location":"Coalinga, California","nn1":["545895","548673","555009","544359","545199","549179","543842","550429","544392","545755","545748","555397","550428","545802","550397","544093"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["shadow","quarter","people","mystery","kind","scenery","surface","interplay","number","ground"]}
