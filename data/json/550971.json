{"path":"550971.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of industrial or possibly residential air pollution. In the foreground, there's a rooftop overlaid with multiple tall chimneys emitting white and gray smoke into the air. The background is filled with dense, lush green trees forming a hill, slightly obscured by the haze of the smoke. The atmosphere is suffused with a muted purplish tone, possibly due to the photographic filter or the natural lighting conditions, which adds a somewhat somber or polluted feel to the scene. The image may be highlighting environmental concerns related to air quality and industrial emissions.","title":"Union carbide's ferro Alloy plant at Alloy, wv., on u.s.
