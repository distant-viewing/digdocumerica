{"path":"547852.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a scene outdoors featuring a cat engaging in an activity by rummaging through the contents of two old, partially damaged trash cans. The cat, which appears to be a tabby, is perched between the two trash cans, which are wrapped and covered in a tattered yellow plastic liner. One of the trash cans is spilling its contents, including what seems to be paper waste, onto the ground.\n\nThe setting is outdoors, evident by the presence of natural light and shadows, along with visible leaves scattered across the ground, suggesting this scene is set perhaps in a backyard or an alley beside some trees. The overall lighting is bright, indicating that the photograph was possibly taken during the day with natural sunlight.\n\nThe composition of the image emphasizes the cat's action, positioned centrally and focused around the interaction between the animal and the trash, thus hinting at a narrative of scavenging or survival. It shows an element of exploration or necessity in the cat's behavior, common to their instincts. The surrounding environment reinforces a slightly unkempt, yet natural urban or semi-urban setting, adding to the gritty realism of the scene.","title":"Cat in garbage can","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547039","556158","554612","549839","551246","549833","547775","556640","550162","552102","552228","544640","547878","548214","544087","542550"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["trash","can","contents","tatter","realism","survival","behavior","alley","backyard","spill"]}
