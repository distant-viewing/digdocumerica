{"path":"554397.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene twilight scene over a still body of water, likely a lake. The sky displays a gradient of colors, ranging from deep violet near the horizon to shades of pink and a hint of orange, suggesting the time is either dawn or dusk. Silhouettes of evergreen trees line the distant shores, extending into the sky and mirrored perfectly in the lake's glassy surface, which adds symmetry and tranquility to the image.\n\nThere is a gentle ripple on the water, possibly from a subtle breeze or a small disturbance at the surface, which slightly distorts the tree reflections, adding a touch of reality to an otherwise calm scene. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and contemplative.\n\nCompositionally, the photo is well balanced, with the treeline creating a natural division between the sky and the reflection in the water. The color palette is rich and moody, and the absence of any human activity or artificial light allows the natural beauty of the sunset and landscape to stand out.","title":"Red spruce silhouetted against sunset sky at Twitchell Lake northeast of Old Forge Village","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["543577","554404","557497","543604","551280","550777","554405","543590","552142","552319","554752","554403","542994","554759","554760","557570"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["violet","reflection","symmetry","lake","treeline","division","reality","pink","breeze","disturbance"]}
