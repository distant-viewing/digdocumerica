{"path":"553927.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a dense cluster of residential houses built on a terraced hillside. The houses predominantly have similar styles and appear as two-story structures with prominent gable roofs and external balconies. The color palette of the houses primarily revolves around beige and brown tones which harmonize with the natural surroundings. \n\nIn the foreground, the slope is moderately steep and features small areas of vegetation, possibly shrubs or small trees. At the bottom, a rocky but partly vegetated area can be seen, leading to an assumption that this could be a developing region or newly expanded residential area.\n\nThe most striking feature of this photograph is the silhouette of a dramatic mountain range in the background. The peaks are jagged and rise distinctly against the sky, framing the settlement. The photograph captures the houses in a way that they almost seem stacked against each other climbing up the hillside, leading to a unique architectural layering effect as the eye moves up towards the rugged peaks. The lighting suggests it might be either dawn or dusk, providing a soft illumination that enhances the moody and serene ambiance of the setting.","title":"Hawaii-Kai, built on a swamp and a hillside, is a fast-growing area east of downtown Honolulu. Scarcity of land and skyrocketing costs are favoring construction of town houses and high-rise apartments over the once dominant single-family units.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553926","553920","556423","557526","546765","557404","552603","553941","553929","557547","553931","553707","556333","557516","544816","557527"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["house","hillside","peak","expand","gable","climb","lead","settlement","illumination","balcony"]}
