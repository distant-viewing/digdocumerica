{"path":"553914.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene where two children are engaged in fishing from a bridge. The foreground displays a boy, focused intently on the task, lowering a small, basket-like fishing trap into the water using a rope. He is dressed in a casual white t-shirt and dark pants. Next to him, partially visible, is another child in a yellow top, who appears to be observing or waiting their turn.\n\nThe bridge itself is concrete, featuring a simple, functional design with a solid guardrail that the children lean against. The body of water below is calm and reflects a partly cloudy sky. The landscape in the background is scenic, showcasing low hills and sparse vegetation along with some developed areas, possibly a small town. The overall mood is peaceful, hinting at a leisurely day spent by the water in a quiet, natural setting.","title":"Hawaiian boy crabbing from bridge","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["552257","543220","550776","554518","553081","542740","543516","544303","544200","552828","557971","551025","546410","551162","551392","552116"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","lower","bridge","trap","guardrail","basket","spend","rope","fish","develop"]}
