{"path":"546261.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a salvage yard or recycling facility. The primary focus is on two flatbed trailers loaded with densely compressed cubes of scrap metal, presumably crushed cars, piled high. The metal cubes exhibit a variety of colors, mostly muted shades of blue, brown, and grey, with exposed internals and crumpled exteriors that reflect their prior state as vehicles.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a person, dressed in a yellow shirt and dark pants, stands facing away from the camera, looking at the trailers. Their posture suggests they are evaluating or inspecting the loads.\n\nIn the background, there is an industrial setting with more piles of scrap metal and machinery scattered around. Notably, there is a large smokestack emitting a plume of dark smoke, contributing to the industrial atmosphere of the scene. The sky is bright and mostly clear, which contrasts with the industrial activity on the ground.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its focus on discarded technology and the implications of industrial activity on the environment, provides a telling glimpse into the world of metal recycling and waste management.","title":"Compacted old cars on flatbed truck are ready for the shredder (in background), at the klean steel manufacturing corporation in Flowood.
