{"path":"544795.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photo exhibits an intriguing scene centered around a wooden structure amidst a natural setting. The structure appears to be made of logs stacked horizontally, perhaps part of a dam or a similar water management system. It is positioned on uneven terrain, with indications of scour and erosion caused by water flow.\n\nWater flows vigorously through and around the structure, cascading down into a small stream. This creates multiple small waterfalls that generate a dynamic and frothy display as the water interacts with the ground and the obstacles in its path. The water's power and movement are evident in its whitish color where it crashes and splashes, contrasting sharply with the darker hues of wet wood and soil.\n\nThe ground where the water flows is richly textured and colored, ranging from reddish-brown to shades of orange, likely indicating mineral deposits or a particular type of soil composition that resists water erosion to some extent. There are no visible plants or vegetation in the immediate area where the water flows, possibly due to the constant disturbance by the moving water.\n\nThe broader environment is not clearly visible, suggesting the focus is solely on the interaction of the wooden structure with the natural water flow. The image evokes themes of natural resource management, erosion, and the dynamic interplay between human-made structures and natural forces.","title":"Water that has been polluted by mineral content seeps from the Argo Mine.","placename":"Idaho Springs (Colo.)","location":"Idaho Springs, Colorado","nn1":["549639","550222","544796","550647","558006","553349","550654","552062","553395","553389","553354","544858","548309","544862","555209","544856"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["erosion","water","flow","management","obstacle","soil","extent","structure","indication","deposit"]}
