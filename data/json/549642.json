{"path":"549642.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features a silhouette of a child standing on a ridge or elevated piece of land. The child is backlit by a soft, diffused light, casting a shadow in front and highlighting the outline of the figure against a somewhat hazy background. It appears to be sunset or sunrise, given the warm tone of the sky and the low angle of the light.\n\nThe child, possibly a boy, is barefoot, wearing shorts, and seems to be looking into the distance. His posture is relaxed, with arms slightly outstretched from his body, conveying a sense of freedom or contemplation.\n\nThe foreground shows the edge of the grassy ridge, with blades of grass sharply defined against the sky. The overall atmosphere of the image is tranquil and contemplative, emphasized by the simple and clean silhouette against a minimalistic background. The photograph might invoke feelings of solitude, peace, or the innocence of childhood in its viewers.","title":"West beach at sunset","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["545859","547738","550241","555140","545863","543688","543791","550233","552035","552331","554423","549105","555206","547727","552940","548222"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["child","backlit","innocence","silhouette","blade","freedom","peace","childhood","invoke","relax"]}
