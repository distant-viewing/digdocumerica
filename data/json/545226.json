{"path":"545226.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking view of a rugged coastline, likely taken from an elevated vantage point on a hillside. The image prominently features a curved shore where frothy white waves break gently on the sandy beach. Large rocks are scattered both along the shoreline and within the shallow waters of the sea.\n\nThe ocean extends into the horizon, meeting the clear blue sky. From the right side of the image to the middle, the coastline is framed by steep cliffs. These cliffs are densely covered in lush greenery, featuring a mix of trees and shrubbery suggesting a temperate coastal environment.\n\nTo the left side of the photo, a lighthouse is visible on a small promontory, standing out with its bright, possibly whitish color against the deeper hues of the surrounding landscape. This lighthouse adds a picturesque element to the seaside setting.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows part of the hillside from which the photograph is taken. It is covered with grasses, small shrubs, and patches of bare earth, indicating some erosion or lesser vegetation coverage compared to the more densely vegetated cliffs.\n\nOverall, the composition combines natural beauty with a hint of human presence (e.g., the lighthouse), emphasizing both the rugged wildness and the scenic tranquility of this coastal landscape.","title":"Oregon coast","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["543184","543300","545125","543061","543291","545129","543297","543090","543250","545106","545222","545230","542917","543085","543086","553805"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["lighthouse","cliff","hillside","coastline","wildness","seaside","coverage","shrubbery","vantage","erosion"]}
