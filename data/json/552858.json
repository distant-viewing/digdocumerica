{"path":"552858.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a vast agricultural landscape characterized by a patchwork of large fields, exhibiting various shades of brown and green. The rectangular and irregular shapes of these fields suggest a diversity of crops or stages of crop development. Thin strips of roads and pathways intersect these fields, allowing access throughout the area.\n\nTo the left side of the image, a section of the terrain appears to be flooded, or perhaps it is a natural water body, featuring clusters of vegetation that could possibly be wetlands or marshy areas found typically near water bodies. This zone contrasts markedly with the rest of the scenery through its textured appearance and darker color, indicating higher water content or different land use.\n\nIn addition to the primarily agricultural focus, sparse areas of forest or dense tree growth punctuate the landscape, providing green pockets that break up the monotony of the farmed fields. These trees could also serve as windbreaks or borders defining property limits.\n\nThe landscape is flat, as evidenced by the absence of significant elevation changes or hills, which is typical for many expansive agricultural regions. In the far background, beyond the immediate scope of the fields, there are hints of further green areas and perhaps distant bodies of water, suggesting this region is part of a larger, diverse ecological and geographical area.\n\nOverall, this image captures a tranquil and productive rural setting, emphasizing the wide-open spaces dedicated to agriculture and the interaction between land and water in environmental management.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years. Unprecedented flooding occurred throughout the river basin. Particularly affected were the marsh area below New Orleans and the entire Atchafalaya River basin flooded farmlands between Alexandria and Baton Rouge.","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["558414","553668","553817","542730","542708","554055","553977","547684","554029","548907","557517","548817","549098","548901","549094","554030"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["field","crop","monotony","scope","limit","water","region","patchwork","addition","land"]}
