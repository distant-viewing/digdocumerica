{"path":"546081.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a peaceful nature scene featuring two swans swimming side by side in a body of water. The view is partially obscured by reeds and various foliage in the foreground, creating a natural frame and adding a sense of depth and seclusion to the image.\n\nThe water reflects a blue sky, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a clear day. The reeds, some of which are out of focus in the foreground, are mostly vertical and create a contrast with the gentle, horizontal ripples on the water's surface caused by the movement of the swans.\n\nThe swans themselves are elegant and serene, with their long necks and white feathers reflecting in the calm water, creating a symmetrical image. Their presence adds a tranquil and graceful element to the scene, emphasizing the beauty of the natural environment.\n\nThe overall composition and the natural elements captured in this photograph make it a serene depiction of wildlife and their habitat.","title":"Ducks in city park lagoon","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["551149","557568","545991","557121","553346","543663","547744","544838","550388","552221","543918","546086","554067","545967","552993","547726"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["reed","feather","seclusion","neck","depiction","water","habitat","wildlife","ripple","movement"]}
