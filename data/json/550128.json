{"path":"550128.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a rainy urban street setting, which appears to be from a bygone era, likely several decades ago given the styles of the vehicles and the condition of the surroundings.\n\nOn the left side of the image, you can see an old-fashioned food stand that is partly visible, painted in a yellow hue with a serving window. Behind the food stand, an aged and somewhat deteriorated Chevrolet truck is parked. The truck's purpose seems to be for selling or advertising various household items, as seen from the large signage on its side that reads a mix of product offerings such as \"Used TV, Ranges, Carpets\" and phrases like \"Save A Lot\" and \"We give you more than you pay for.\"\n\nIn the center of the photograph, an elderly man wearing a dark jacket, pants, and a hat—typical attire for a chilly, wet day—is walking along the sidewalk. He is carrying a large, brown paper bag that appears to be quite full, likely with groceries or goods.\n\nThe background features a line of buildings along the street. The most prominent sign among them reads \"The Ge….ck,\" suggesting the name of a business, but the full name is obscured.\n\nThe street itself is lined with parked cars that reflect automotive styles from the mid-20th century, which adds to the historical feel of the image. The weather is overcast, and the wet pavement suggests recent rainfall.\n\nThis vivid capture of everyday life in a past decade offers a small window into the period's urban environment, transportation, and consumer goods while highlighting a solitary figure in his routine endeavor, possibly running errands or returning from shopping.","title":"Amish shopper on busy thoroughfare in Middlefield","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551863","549832","551873","550138","551868","546672","550319","552965","546643","546639","548275","554299","556225","556710","556224","546660"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["goods","food","decade","street","save","name","like","truck","grocery","rainy"]}
