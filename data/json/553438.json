{"path":"553438.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a riverbank, surrounded by a lush forest. In the image, a young man is swinging from a rope attached to a tree, suspended in mid-air above the river. His posture suggests motion, likely swinging out over the water, and his expression indicates he is enjoying the activity.\n\nOn the bank, three other individuals—two men and a child—are watching the swinging man. The first man and the child are standing close together, watching intently, while the second man appears to be holding onto a smaller child who is also observing the scene. Both adult spectators are dressed in swimsuits.\n\nOn the right side of the image, partially in the water, a woman stands wearing a bikini. She is looking towards the man on the rope, contributing to the overall focus on his activity.\n\nThe background features dense trees, suggesting this scene is set in a secluded, natural area. The exposed roots of the tree from which the rope hangs, along with the sandy bank, emphasize a rustic, untouched setting. This idyllic summer activity scene encapsulates a moment of joy and recreation, enhanced by the natural beauty surrounding the group.","title":"This favorite spot for swimming in the Squannacook River is located near Groton in the town forest preserve.
