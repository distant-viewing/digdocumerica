{"path":"557187.jpg","date":"February 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph features a vibrant yellow and blue Santa Fe diesel locomotive train, prominently displaying its name along its side in large, bold letters. The train number, 8784, is visible on the side of the locomotive's cab which is yellow. Positioned in a landscape setting, patches of snow cover the ground, indicating a season of late fall to early winter. There are leafless bushes and trees visible in the foreground, adding a natural, somewhat barren texture to the scene. In the background, other dark-colored freight train cars can be seen parked on adjacent tracks, indicating a railway yard or similar freight handling area. A series of telephone or telegraph poles, lined with multiple cross arms and wires, run parallel to the train track, reinforcing the industrial nature of the scene. The day appears bright and clear, with a blue sky visible above. The entire scene captures a moment of industrial activity within a somewhat rural or underdeveloped landscape.","title":"Santa Fe railroad engine on the tracks in Johnson County, Kansas, near Kansas City. Tallgrass prairie is seen in the foreground. The tracks follow the Kansas River along the general route of the early explorers who made trails through the area. Much of the state was tallgrass prairie before the wave of settlers in the last century. Several sites are under consideration in Kansas for a tallgrass prairie national park.","placename":"Johnson County (Kan.)","location":"Johnson County, Kansas","nn1":["556120","556119","556850","556857","556408","556784","556029","554834","556104","556003","555986","556882","556022","556058","549131","556759"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","locomotive","freight","track","cab","telephone","cross","handling","fall","railway"]}
