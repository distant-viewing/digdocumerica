{"path":"549101.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features an artistic depiction of three birds perched on the stark, bare branches of a tree. The entire image is suffused in a deep red tone, creating a dramatic and monochrome backdrop. The birds, depicted as silhouettes, are positioned at varying heights along the tree. The highest bird appears to be either landing or preparing to take off, as suggested by its slightly spread wings. The branches stretch diagonally across the frame, giving a sense of asymmetry and dynamic motion. The composition and the monochromatic red color scheme contribute to a somewhat surreal and minimalist aesthetic, emphasizing shapes and forms over color details. The background is uniformly red, without any gradation or additional elements, focusing all attention on the silhouetted figures of the birds and branches.","title":"American egrets roosting on a tree in Colorado river indian reservation, south of parker","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["554069","555013","548872","544612","557208","550382","544601","549095","551378","544547","557628","547318","544597","553875","554601","543595"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","branch","suffuse","gradation","landing","bare","wing","perch","scheme","depiction"]}
