{"path":"555398.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a young child, likely a toddler, dressed warmly in a pink and orange bulky jacket with white fur trim around the hood, and matching pants. The child is kneeling on a wet sandy surface, which appears to be a beach. Their attention is focused on something small in the sand, as they seem to be intently examining or playing with it.\n\nThe environment suggests a cool or cold day due to the protective outdoor clothing worn by the child. The background consists of a dark, blurred tree line far behind the child, indicating that the beach may be near a forested area. The sky is overcast, and the natural light is soft and diffuse, lacking sharp shadows.\n\nThe scene conveys a sense of tranquility and curiosity, highlighted by the child's absorbed interaction with their immediate surroundings, away from direct human influence. The vast, empty space around the child emphasizes their smallness in the wide, open environment.","title":"Just like the beach, the Columbia River is shown here at Rooster Rock state park 18 miles east of Portland at a record low the young girl plays on river beds never seen before and exposed more than three months because of a lack of precipitation the previous year","placename":"Oregon","location":"Oregon","nn1":["552279","544380","549105","547727","550241","548119","552940","547676","550244","542768","550233","543457","549254","545539","544200","543496"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","beach","toddler","fur","absorb","kneel","hood","curiosity","influence","match"]}
