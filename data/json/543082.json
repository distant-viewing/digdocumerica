{"path":"543082.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures an unconventional and artistically surreal scene on a beach at twilight. The primary subject is an unusually large and sharply vertical log, dramatically embedded into the sand, creating a dominant visual focal point in the image. Its top is jagged and uneven, suggesting it might have been broken off rather than sawed. There is subtle texturing visible on the log, giving a sense of its rough surface.\n\nIn the background, two smaller logs lie horizontally on the beach. The farthest scene shows another strikingly tall, slender figure (likely another vertical log) planted in the sand, surrounded by a small cluster of people gathered around a possible campfire, giving the scene a hint of human activity and life.\n\nThe color tone of the photograph is primarily in shades of purple and dark blue, contributing to a moody and mysterious atmosphere. The sky blends seamlessly with the beach, reflecting the low light conditions of either dawn or dusk.\n\nThe overall composition uses the placement of these logs and the small human gathering to create a sense of scale and isolation within the vast space of the beach, amplified by the expansive, flat sandy foreground and the enigmatic twilight ambiance.","title":"Driftwood appears to take root in sand.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546961","543054","542889","542890","543075","543052","545111","543069","542886","543081","542887","555101","542888","542884","544989","542973"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["log","beach","twilight","sand","campfire","placement","dawn","dusk","gathering","cluster"]}
