{"path":"546730.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a multi-lane road bustling with vehicular activity, indicative of a typical urban setting. The road is filled with cars, mostly vintage models given their design and shape, suggesting the photo could be from several decades ago. The cars display a variety of colors such as red, blue, white, yellow, and green, adding vibrant hues to the scene.\n\nIn the central part of the image, the road curves gently, while clearly marked lanes help direct the traffic flow. To the sides of the road, there are patches of lush green grass, enhancing the urban scene with a touch of nature. Thereâ€™s also another road perpendicular to the busy street visible in another part of the photo, lined with a few more cars, adding depth to the scene.\n\nOn the edges of the road, besides the grassy areas, sidewalks can be seen, although there are no pedestrians visible. There's also a set of traffic lights, which are likely managing the flow of the vehicles. The overall perspective provided by the aerial view offers a comprehensive snapshot of daily life in a busy urban road system.","title":"Minor accident on Maine Avenue","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546716","547776","552711","549919","546370","546617","546707","546686","546681","546616","548342","556732","548391","556195","546710","551478"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["road","flow","traffic","car","set","decade","lane","curve","pedestrian","sidewalk"]}
