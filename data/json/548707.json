{"path":"548707.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph displays a somewhat somber natural scene on a beach. The ground is covered in a mixture of sandy patches and layers of various marine debris. Prominently, thereâ€™s a substantial amount of decomposing seaweed and driftwood scattered across. Among this debris, an old, tattered magazine or comic book cover lies prominently in the foreground, showing signs of water damage and fading, featuring cartoonish characters and text that suggests it could be a pop culture publication.\n\nTwo dense, lush green bushes with broad leaves are situated at the shoreline, partly obscuring the view of the water behind them. These bushes appear healthy and contrast starkly with the littered beach. The sky above is partly cloudy, hinting at open air and natural light, while the overall atmosphere seems calm yet slightly melancholic due to the pollution depicted.","title":"Beach of a small, undeveloped key called Little Duck.
