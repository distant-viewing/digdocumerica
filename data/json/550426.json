{"path":"550426.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and expansive natural landscape, likely taken in a high latitude or alpine region. The foreground is densely covered with tundra vegetation, displaying bright autumnal huesâ€”reds, oranges, and deep greens. This colorful ground cover suggests it might be late summer or early fall. Scattered across the tundra are small rocks and boulders, adding texture to the scene.\n\nMidground of the image features a large, shallow body of water that stretches horizontally across the field of view. The water body appears calm, reflecting slight ripples which hint at a gentle breeze.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dramatic mountain range that rises steeply from the plains. The mountains have rugged, rocky facades with steep slopes, and their coloration varies from dark grays to lighter shades, indicating different rock formations. A few patches of snow or possibly light-colored rocks can be seen clinging to crevices in the mountains, suggesting that the climate is cold.\n\nAbove the landscape, the sky is clear with a few scattered clouds, indicating fair weather. The overall lighting suggests either morning or late afternoon, given the softness and angle of the light, enhancing the vivid colors of the tundra and creating a sense of tranquility and isolation. The vastness of the scene, combined with its unspoilt nature, evokes a feeling of remote wilderness. There are no visible human elements or structures, reinforcing the wild, untamed beauty of the scene.","title":"Peak 5308 and the west portal entrance to the atigun gorge from a point south of galbraith camp.
