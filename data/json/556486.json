{"path":"556486.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts a seated man facing the camera directly, housed in an interior setting. He is seated in a wheelchair, which appears to be metal framed with a cushioned seat. The man has a stern expression and is dressed in a dark navy blue shirt that is unbuttoned at the collar. His arms are crossed over his chest, conveying a guarded or assertive demeanor.\n\nHis physical features include slicked back hair and a strong jawline. His serious expression contributes to an intense and forthright air. The setting seems to be a room with wood-paneled walls and minimal decoration. Behind him, there is a wall with a cheerful, colorful painting, which contrasts with his serious demeanor. The painting seems abstract, featuring bright colors and rounded shapes.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph centers on the man, highlighted by the intimacy of a close-up shot that captures both the intricate details of his appearance and the contrasting surroundings. The lighting is soft yet focused, drawing attention to his facial features and the reflective aspects of the metal wheelchair.","title":"Jack smith, 42, Rhodell, West Virginia, seated in the beer joint he operates in a wheel-chair bought for him by his friend arnold miller, president of the united mine workers union.
