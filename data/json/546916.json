{"path":"546916.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of outdoor labor in a natural setting, evoking a sense of rustic endeavor amid a serene environment. The main focus of the image is a man standing on a log that stretches across a small, narrow stream. He is in the process of throwing or moving a sizable rock or slab, which produces a cloud of dust or steam around him as he handles it. He is dressed in typical outdoor work attire, including a jacket and possibly rubber boots, suitable for rough, muddy conditions.\n\nThe setting is a wooded area, possibly a small clearing. The trees are bare, suggesting it might be late autumn or winter, and there is little underbrush or green foliage visible, giving a stark but natural feel to the surroundings. The stream where the man stands looks to be part of a construction or maintenance site, indicated by the presence of some construction debris or materials in the foreground, including gravel and planks of wood.\n\nThe photograph, likely taken during twilight or a cloudy day given the soft ambient light, effectively captures the man's positioning and the rugged environment. The man's activity, possibly related to landscaping, environmental restoration, or construction work, suggests laborious engagement with nature. The overall feel is one of isolation and endeavor in a natural setting, highlighting the interaction between humans and the environment in a work-related context.","title":"After a spill of 4000 gallons of oil, workers have placed booms across Stony Run to contain the oil, and a special material to soak it up.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["553612","553614","545060","542771","553648","552545","550251","553642","553613","553647","545649","557735","552109","545371","553641","556447"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["endeavor","construction","stream","work","restoration","slab","rubber","man","positioning","landscaping"]}
