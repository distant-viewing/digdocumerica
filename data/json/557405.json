{"path":"557405.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph shows a suburban neighborhood characterized by rows of closely packed two-story houses. Each house has a similar architectural style featuring gabled roofs and rectangular windows. The houses are painted in various colors such as beige, light blue, yellow, and red, which adds visual diversity to the uniform structural designs. The houses are separated by small, well-maintained lawns, and some have visible driveways. The neighborhood is closely surrounded by lush greenery, with trees filling the spaces between and behind the buildings, contributing to a tranquil suburban atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, more similar-style houses are visible atop a slight hill, repeating the pattern seen in the foreground. Farther behind, dense trees establish a natural barrier at the edge of the community, suggesting the neighborhood is located near a forested area or park. There is a noticeable presence of an electrical tower in the background among the trees, indicating infrastructure development within a semi-rural setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, taken from an elevated perspective, captures the essence of residential planning in suburban America, focusing on uniformity in housing while still offering some individuality through color and landscaping. The image evokes a sense of quiet residential life, typical of many suburban neighborhoods.","title":"House of boomer seen from across kanawha river.
