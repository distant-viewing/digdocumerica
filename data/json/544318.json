{"path":"544318.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph captures a moment during an indoor gathering where several individuals are engaged in a serious activity. The focus is on one woman in the foreground. She is wearing a blue and white checkered blouse and is intently writing or taking notes in a notebook she holds with her left hand, while a pen is positioned in her right hand. Her expression is concentrated and contemplative.\n\nTo the left and slightly behind her, another woman is visible. She wears a darker, plaid shirt, and her hair is styled back, possibly held by a hair accessory. Her silhouette and posture suggest that she, too, is engaged in a similar activity, though she is blurred and partially out of frame, which directs the viewer's attention more strongly to the woman in the foreground.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, part of another individual can be observed, wearing a yellow shirt, but this individual is mostly out of the frame and out of focus, making their activity less discernible.\n\nThe environment suggests a simple indoor setting, most likely a place for study or meetings, as indicated by the concentration on reading and note-taking. The lighting in the photograph has a slightly dramatic quality, likely due to the use of artificial light sources, which casts deep shadows and highlights on the subjects, enhancing the mood of focused work or study. The overall atmosphere is one of serious engagement in the task at hand, possibly a workshop or a class setting.","title":"Training class for HavaSupai teachers in reading and language instruction methods","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["556264","554332","557038","545547","546479","557682","544314","557704","555290","551436","545083","556028","554344","546526","542690","558225"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["note","study","hand","woman","notebook","class","accessory","meeting","reading","individual"]}
