{"path":"547228.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph provides a comprehensive view of a busy urban area, likely capturing a significant administrative or historical district. The image foreground features a circular fountain with a spouting water jet, surrounded by a neatly structured area with pathways, a few benches, and young trees bordered up in a round form. There's a raised, curved road that wraps around this fountain area.\n\nIn the middle ground of the photograph, a bustling parking lot is filled with hundreds of cars, tightly packed, suggesting perhaps a day of significant public interest or an event. There is a large building with a modern design adjacent to the parking area, characterized by its plain, boxy architecture and horizontal strip windows.\n\nIn the background, the iconic Washington Monument stands tall and distinct against the city's skyline, suggesting that this photo is set in Washington D.C. Behind this monument, various classical architecture buildings are visible which might be governmental or significant historical structures typical of the city’s landscape. The further backdrop shows a glimpse of the city stretching into the distance, interspersed with trees and some smaller buildings under a clear blue sky.\n\nThe combination of architecture from different eras, the densely packed cars, and the alignment of streets and monuments also provides a view of the city’s layout and urban planning. Overall, the scene is busy yet orderly, reflecting a dynamic city atmosphere.","title":"Southwest Washington, D.C. with south end of L'Enfant Plaza in foreground, Southwest Freeway, Department of Agriculture and Washington Monument beyond.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547267","546679","546692","546585","546570","546741","552726","546577","551661","547226","552705","551647","546624","546693","546745","551663"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Transportation Hubs"],"terms":["city","monument","fountain","architecture","parking","alignment","jet","planning","district","strip"]}
